I did so in the knowledge that I was \\njoining a highly respected, values-driven \\nbusiness, known for quality, value and \\ncustomer service. Sainsbury’s has a long \\nand\\xa0distinguished heritage and I’m delighted \\nto have become Chairman during the \\nCompany’s 150th anniversary year.\\n\\nI have spent my first few months learning as \\nmuch as I can about the business by visiting \\nstores, distribution centres and store support \\ncentres around the country. In talking to \\ncolleagues at all levels of the business, as \\nwell as to suppliers and other key industry \\nstakeholders, I have been struck by a \\nnumber of things. \\n\\nFirstly, that in Sainsbury’s, Argos and \\nSainsbury’s Bank, we have three of the most \\ntrusted brands in UK retail. We offer \\ncustomers strong, distinctive ranges of high \\nquality food, clothing, general merchandise \\nand financial services, available through \\nconvenient, well-established channels and \\nwith home delivery and Click & Collect. \\n\\nI have also been hugely impressed by the \\nenthusiasm and commitment of our \\ncolleagues, by their passion for our business \\nand by their relentless focus on quality and \\ncustomer service. Though the retail \\nenvironment has become fiercely \\ncompetitive and fast moving, I believe that \\nour strong management team, working \\nunder the leadership of Mike Coupe, will \\ncontinue to enhance our strong business. \\n\\nThis has been a big year of change across \\nthe\\xa0business and I would like to thank Mike, \\nthe Operating Board and all of our colleagues \\nfor their hard work and commitment.\\n\\nStrategy\\nIn the current retail market, it is obvious \\nthat\\xa0standing still is not an option. We must \\ncontinue to adapt to market forces and \\nmeet\\xa0the needs of our customers. We\\xa0were, \\ntherefore, very disappointed by the \\nCompetition and Markets Authority’s \\ndecision on our proposed merger with Asda. \\nWe strongly believe that the deal would have \\nbenefited our customers and our business.\\n\\nSince we changed the way we run \\nSainsbury’s stores last year, our colleagues \\nhave worked hard to improve store \\nstandards, service and availability for our \\ncustomers. We have also reduced costs, \\nwhich supports our drive to invest in making \\ncommodity products better value for our \\ncustomers. Customers continue to rate us \\ntop for quality food and we are growing our \\npremium ranges.\\n\\nWe have an excellent store estate in great \\nlocations and will invest in over 800 \\nsupermarkets and convenience stores this \\nyear, rolling out our beauty concept, wellness \\naisles, food to go and integrated general \\nmerchandise and clothing sections.\\n\\n£4.7 billion of our sales are generated \\nthrough our digital channels and we will \\ninvest more in technology to make shopping \\nacross Sainsbury’s, Argos and Sainsbury’s \\nBank as easy and seamless as possible. \\nIntegrating Nectar more fully into the \\nbusiness also supports our strategy of \\nknowing our customers better than \\nanyone\\xa0else.\\n\\nWe are delivering on our strategic objective \\nto grow the proportion of secured lending \\non\\xa0Sainsbury’s Bank’s balance sheet and to \\nreduce regulatory capital requirements. \\n\\nIn a very competitive market, we have \\nincreased underlying profits to £635 million, \\ngrowing underlying earnings per share by \\n7.8 per cent to\\xa022.0 pence per share. \\n\\nWe have announced a number of steps we \\nare taking to grow value for our shareholders. \\nWe will continue to strengthen our balance \\nsheet and reduce net debt significantly \\nand\\xa0improve free cash flow over the next \\nthree years. \\n\\nBusiness activity in the year\\nOur customers continue to rate the quality of \\nour food ahead of our competitors and we \\noutperformed the market in our premium \\nfood ranges as well as in our growing \\nconvenience store and online grocery \\nchannels. We have successfully integrated \\nArgos, which outperformed a highly \\ncompetitive and promotional market this \\nyear and delivered £160 million of synergies \\nnine months ahead of our original schedule. \\nWe have 281 Argos stores in our \\nsupermarkets, making shopping easy and \\nconvenient for our customers. Clothing sales \\ndeclined in an extremely competitive market \\nbut full-price clothing sales increased after \\nwe removed one of our promotional events.\\n\\nSainsbury’s Bank is well positioned in a \\ncompetitive financial services market and \\nits\\xa0underlying operating profits were in line \\nwith our guidance, at\\xa0£31\\xa0million. We will \\ncontinue to grow our mortgage business, \\nincrease revenues and drive customer \\nloyalty over the coming year. \\n\\nTechnology has enabled us to improve \\nefficiency and customer service across the \\nbusiness. SmartShop – available in over 100 \\nsupermarkets – allows customers to scan \\ntheir purchases using a hand-held device \\nor\\xa0their mobile phone and customers \\ncan\\xa0use Pay@Browse in 162 Argos stores, \\nenabling them to pay digitally, without \\nqueuing at a\\xa0till. \\n\\nOur values are integral to our business and \\nI\\xa0am delighted that we are celebrating our \\n150th year by introducing a volunteering \\nscheme that builds on our heritage, enabling \\nour colleagues to make a real difference in \\ntheir local communities.\\n\\nBoard changes\\nI would like to thank David Tyler for his \\nsignificant contribution to the business and \\nfor his leadership of the Board during his \\ntime as Chairman. I am also personally \\ngrateful for the smooth transition he ensured \\nfor me when I joined the Board as Chairman \\nDesignate. I look forward to leading our \\nstrong and diverse Board, with its mix of \\nskills, gender and ethnicity.\\n\\nWe appointed Clodagh Moriarty to the \\nOperating Board in June to lead the Group’s \\ndigital strategy, ensuring customers have an \\nintegrated and seamless digital experience \\nacross Sainsbury’s, Argos, Sainsbury’s Bank \\nand Nectar.\\n\\nDividend\\nIn line with our policy of paying a dividend \\nthat is covered 2.0 times by underlying \\nearnings, we propose to pay a final dividend \\nof 7.9 pence per share, bringing our full-year \\ndividend to 11.0 pence per share, an increase \\nof 7.8 per cent.\\n\\nOutlook\\nThe retail market remains highly competitive. \\nWe have the right strategy in place and a \\nclear plan for the year ahead. Combined with \\ncommitted, hard-working colleagues led by \\na talented, experienced leadership team, \\nI\\xa0believe we are well placed for the future. \\n\\nMartin Scicluna\\nChairman\\n\\n 03Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic R\\neport\\n\\nFinancial Statem\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we celebrate our 150th anniversary, \\nGroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Coupe \\n\\nlooks back on the year. \\n\\n2018/19 highlights\\n\\n£635m\\nUnderlying profit before tax\\n\\n£32,412m\\nGroup sales (inc VAT)\\n\\n£220m\\nCost savings\\n\\n£222m\\nReduction in net debt\\n\\nWhen we opened our doors on Drury Lane \\nin\\xa01869, Mary Ann and John James Sainsbury \\npromised customers ‘quality perfect, prices \\nlower’. I’m proud to say that our focus on giving \\ncustomers high quality food at good value \\nremains as true today as it was 150 years ago. \\n\\nWe have been delivering on our strategy \\nfor the past four and a half years and \\n\\nthe last year in particular has been \\na big year of change for the business. \\n\\nShopping habits continue to evolve and \\nwe are therefore updating our strategic \\npriorities. We have set the business up \\nfor the long term and have a clear plan \\n\\nfor the year ahead.”\\n\\nMike Coupe \\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nQ&A\\n04 Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nHow would you sum up the \\nlast year?\\nWe are committed to helping customers \\nlive\\xa0well for less, so I was disappointed by \\nthe Competition and Markets Authority’s \\ndecision on our proposed merger with Asda, \\nwhich would have enabled us to reduce the \\ncost of living for millions of households \\nthrough £1 billion of lower prices. \\n\\nI remain confident in our strategy as a \\nstandalone business. We know what we \\nneed to do to respond to changing customer \\nshopping habits and an increasing focus \\non\\xa0value. \\n\\nWe have achieved a lot this year and we \\nknow there is more to do. Some of the key \\nachievements include completing the largest \\nreorganisation in Sainsbury’s stores for more \\nthan a decade. This transformed the way \\nwe\\xa0work by creating a more efficient and \\neffective management structure. A single fair \\nand consistent contract for all Sainsbury’s \\nstore colleagues gives us greater flexibility \\nto\\xa0ensure colleagues are always in the right \\nplace for our customers. In recognition of this, \\nwe increased base rates of pay to an industry-\\nleading £9.20 per hour, taking Sainsbury’s \\nstore colleagues’ total pay increase over the \\npast four years to 30 per cent. \\n\\nWe completed the integration of Argos, \\ndelivering synergies of £160 million nine \\nmonths ahead of our original schedule. \\nWe\\xa0have 281 Argos stores in Sainsbury’s \\nsupermarkets, as we make better use of the \\nspace in our stores to enable customers to do \\nmore of their shopping easily and conveniently \\nunder one roof. \\n\\nWe continue to adapt to changing customer \\nshopping habits. Our digital capability \\nis\\xa0increasingly important, both to support \\ncolleagues and improve the shopping \\nexperience for our customers. Argos is a \\ntechnology-led retailer and sales generated \\nthrough mobile devices passed £2 billion this \\nyear. SmartShop is now available in over 100 \\nsupermarkets, allowing customers to scan \\ntheir shopping using a hand-held device or \\ntheir mobile phone. We were the first grocer \\nin the UK to introduce SmartShop Mobile \\nPay, enabling customers in eight of our \\nconvenience stores to pay on their \\nsmartphone from anywhere in the store, \\nsaving them time and helping them manage \\ntheir budgets. As we develop our Nectar \\noffer, we are trialling a new digital \\nproposition in Wales which gives customers \\ngreater choice over their rewards managed \\nconveniently via their mobile phones.\\n\\nWe are committed to paying above the \\nNational Living Wage, rewarding great work \\nwith great pay. We increased the hourly rate \\nof pay for the majority of Argos colleagues \\nfrom £8 to £8.50 from April, bringing \\nthe\\xa0total increase to 18 per cent since \\nwe\\xa0acquired Argos in September 2016.\\n\\nAre you pleased with the \\nGroup’s performance?\\nI am pleased that we have increased \\nunderlying profits, reduced net debt and \\nincreased the dividend. In the context of a \\nvery competitive retail market, though Group \\nlike-for-like sales decreased by 0.2 per cent, \\nwe continued to deliver on our strategy, \\ngrowing underlying profit before tax to £635 \\nmillion, driven by a solid food performance \\nand the Argos synergies we have delivered \\nahead of schedule. \\n\\nFood remains at the heart of our business. \\nOur strength and growth in premium, \\nvalue-added ranges help us to invest in \\nmaking our commodity ranges better value. \\nIn this highly competitive area, we know we \\nhave more to do to grow sales. Following the \\nimportant structural changes we made in \\nSainsbury’s stores last year, we have made \\nsignificant improvements to store standards \\nin recent months, which remain a focus. Our \\nConvenience and Groceries Online channels \\nremain strong drivers of growth, with sales \\nincreases of 3.7 per cent and 6.9 per cent \\nrespectively. \\n\\nGeneral Merchandise and Clothing \\ndelivered\\xa0a solid performance, with Argos \\noutperforming a highly competitive and \\npromotional market. Having reduced the \\nnumber of promotional events, our Tu clothing \\nrange outperformed a challenging market and \\nincreased full price sales. \\n\\nOur focus on increasing efficiencies delivered \\noverall cost savings of £220 million. We have \\nreduced net debt by £222 million to £1,636 \\nmillion and we are targeting a further \\nreduction in net debt of at least £600 million \\nin the next three years. We have strong cash \\ngeneration with retail free cash flow of £461 \\nmillion. In line with our affordable dividend \\npolicy, this year’s final dividend is 7.9 pence \\nper share, bringing the full-year dividend to \\n11.0 pence per share, an increase of \\n7.8 per cent compared to last year.\\n\\nHow are you celebrating your \\n150th anniversary and what will \\nthe next 150 years look like?\\nWhen we opened our doors on Drury Lane \\nin\\xa01869, Mary Ann and John James Sainsbury \\npromised customers “quality perfect, prices \\nlower”. I’m proud to say that our focus on \\ngiving customers high quality food at good \\nvalue remains as true today as it was 150 \\nyears ago. \\n\\nIn that time, we’ve remained true to our \\nvalues, which continue to be integral to the \\nway we do business and allow us to drive \\nlasting, positive change in the communities \\nwe serve. So, one way we are marking our \\nanniversary is by giving all of our colleagues \\nthe chance to volunteer for one day with \\na\\xa0local charity or community initiative. \\n\\nWith our experienced management team \\nand talented colleagues, we are well placed \\nto maximise the opportunities for growth \\nand create value for our stakeholders. As we \\nlook to the next 150 years, our success will be \\nrooted in knowing what our customers want \\nand we will continue to strive to ensure that \\nour colleagues reflect the great diversity of \\nthe communities we serve. We must also \\nkeep pace with our customers’ changing \\nlives, so\\xa0that shopping with us remains easy \\nand convenient and new technology will \\nplay an\\xa0important role in this.\\n\\nWhat is the Group’s focus \\nfor the year ahead?\\nWe have been delivering on our strategy for \\nthe past four and a half years and the last year \\nin particular has been a big year of change for \\nthe business. Shopping habits continue to \\nevolve and we are therefore updating our \\nstrategic priorities for the year ahead. \\n\\nCustomers rate us first for food quality, \\nbut\\xa0we know there is more to do to make \\nour\\xa0commodity products better value for \\ncustomers and grow sales in those categories. \\nWe have completed the Sainsbury’s store \\ntransformation and made significant \\nimprovements to store standards in recent \\nmonths and this will continue to be a focus \\nthis year, using our new customer feedback \\nservice, Lettuce Know, to inform store \\nmanagers on how customers feel about \\nshopping in their specific store in real time. \\nWe are investing significantly in our store \\nestate this year – we trialled enhanced \\nbeauty ranges, wellness aisles and new \\nconcession partnerships last year and will \\nbe\\xa0rolling these out to more stores this year. \\nIn\\xa0total, we will invest in over 400 supermarkets \\nthis year.\\n\\nWe have completed the Argos integration, \\ndelivering the £160 million of synergies and \\nthere is more we can do this year to continue \\nto bring the businesses closer together to \\ndrive efficiencies and also to improve the \\ncustomer experience.\\n\\n£4.7 billion of our revenue now comes from \\nour online businesses and we are increasing \\ninvestment in technology to make shopping \\nacross Sainsbury’s, Argos and Sainsbury’s \\nBank as quick and convenient as possible \\nand to make the business more efficient.\\n\\nWe will also continue to strengthen our \\nbalance sheet and are making a new \\ncommitment to reduce net debt by at least \\n£600 million over the next three years.\\n\\nWe have set the business up for the long term \\nand have a clear plan for the year ahead.\\n\\nMike Coupe\\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\\n\\n 05Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic R\\neport\\n\\nFinancial Statem\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket context\\n\\nThe market\\nEconomic conditions eased slightly for UK consumers over the last \\n12\\xa0months, as average weekly earnings grew ahead of a reducing \\ninflation burden for most of the year. Despite this, consumer confidence \\nwas impacted by the continuing uncertainty around Brexit.\\n\\nLower levels of inflation and declining consumer confidence have \\nresulted in reduced sales growth in both the food and non-food \\nsectors. Non-food retailers were particularly impacted by weak \\ndemand, rising costs and the ongoing impact of increasing online \\npenetration, driving further consolidation and restructuring of \\nthe\\xa0sector.\\n\\nRetail trends \\nThe past year has seen continued rapid change in how customers \\nshop in the UK. With greater access to a variety of shopping channels, \\nthe UK consumer has more flexibility and choice than ever in how \\nand when they shop for food, general merchandise and clothing. \\nBarriers to entry in some of these channels are far lower than before, \\ngiving disruptors the opportunity to gain strong footholds across the \\nretail landscape. The impact of this can be seen in the record levels \\nof\\xa0store closures, traditional retail business collapses and redundancy \\nfor retail colleagues. Restructuring of the UK retail industry is likely \\nto\\xa0continue for some time given rising cost pressures in wages, rates \\nand other fixed costs.\\n\\nConsumers are shopping for groceries more frequently across \\ndifferent channels and store formats, with online and convenience \\nchannels showing strong growth. There is limited new space being \\nadded to the market from traditional grocers but discount and \\nbargain retailers continue to open significant numbers of new stores \\nand gain market share. Consumers are also eating more meals \\noutside the home and the growth of food delivery services such as \\nDeliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats is also impacting grocery spending. \\n\\nHigh streets and retail parks continue to experience footfall and \\nsales\\xa0declines as online participation grows. A key driver of the trend \\ntowards general merchandise and clothing being bought online is \\nthe\\xa0wide choice of delivery and pick-up options. Delivery services \\nhave improved in terms of speed and reliability, while Click & Collect \\nis both cost-effective and convenient for customers and accounts \\nfor\\xa0a significant proportion of online general merchandise and \\nclothing sales. \\n\\nRetailers that can fulfil their customers’ needs flexibly, rapidly and \\nconveniently, offering a consistent experience to consumers across \\nall channels, will be set up to succeed in this increasingly tough and \\ncompetitive retail environment.\\n\\nAverage annual weekly earnings growth CPI inflation\\n\\n4%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n1%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n-1%\\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\\n\\nUK average weekly earnings growth vs inflation\\n\\nSource: ONS\\n\\nFood Non-food\\n\\n5.5%\\n\\n4.5%\\n\\n3.5%\\n\\n2.5%\\n\\n1.5%\\n\\n0.5%\\n\\n-0.5%\\n\\n-1.5%\\n2016 2017 2018 2019\\n\\nBRC total retail market year-on-year growth, three month rolling\\n\\nSource: BRC\\n\\nRetail sales, three month (% change) GfK Consumer Confidence\\n\\n7%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n1%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n10\\n\\n5\\n\\n0\\n\\n-5\\n\\n-10\\n\\n-15\\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\\n\\nConsumer confidence\\n\\nSource: BRC & GfK\\n\\n06 Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nSainsbury’s response to a competitive  \\nand evolving market\\n\\nOur strategy is to respond to the changing needs of our customers \\nand enable them to shop with us whenever and wherever they want. \\n\\nThe quality of our food continues to be a strong differentiator and \\nwe\\xa0are working in partnership with our suppliers to bring exclusive, \\ninnovative and distinctive products to our customers. We are adapting \\nour supermarket space to serve a wide variety of shopping missions, \\nensuring we offer customers a broad range of products and services \\nunder one roof. This includes Argos stores as well as popular brands \\nsuch as Specsavers, Sushi Gourmet and Explore Learning. Maximising \\nthe productivity of our supermarket space in\\xa0this way is\\xa0driving an \\nincrease in trading intensity across our supermarket estate. We have \\nalso transformed the way we run Sainsbury’s stores, fundamentally \\nchanging how our managers and\\xa0colleagues work, aligning better \\nwith the ways customers shop.\\n\\nIn the fast-growing Groceries Online channel, technological \\nimprovements have improved productivity and helped to drive sales, \\nmaking this channel to market more profitable. Our convenience \\nstore estate consists of over 800 stores and is outperforming the \\nmarket in value and volume as we continue to tailor the ranges we \\noffer to ensure they reflect the local demographics and different \\nshopping missions in each store. \\n\\nOur General Merchandise and Clothing business is performing well \\nin\\xa0a highly competitive market and we had 281 Argos stores in our \\nsupermarkets at year end. Argos’s unique hub and spoke distribution \\nnetwork enables quick, convenient and efficient fulfilment of \\ncustomer orders for collection or home delivery. Our Fast Track \\ncollection and delivery channels have grown significantly as the \\ncombination of a strong online proposition and a wide availability of \\ndelivery and pick-up options continues to be popular with customers. \\n\\nWe have accelerated the rate of change across the Group, with a \\nfocus on technology-led innovation that makes shopping faster, \\neasier and more convenient for our customers. SmartShop self-scan, \\nwhich enables customers to scan their shopping directly on to their \\nphone or hand-held device, is available in over 100 supermarkets. \\nWe\\xa0were the first grocer in the UK to introduce SmartShop mobile \\npay in eight convenience stores, enabling customers to bypass the \\ncheckout and pay on their smartphone from anywhere in the store. \\nPay@Browse is currently available in 162 Argos stores, offering \\ncustomers a convenient payment option without the need to queue \\nat a till. We have also introduced a visual search function which \\nallows customers to search the Argos product range using a photo \\nof\\xa0the product they want.\\n\\nWe have delivered £160 million EBITDA of synergies from the acquisition \\nof Argos. Together with ongoing cost savings progress and a focus \\non\\xa0maintaining balance sheet strength, we are confident that we have \\nthe resources to remain competitive in our rapidly changing markets.\\n\\nSupermarkets (including Argos stores in supermarkets)\\nConvenience Groceries Online\\n\\n8%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n1.0%\\n\\n3.7%\\n\\n7%\\n\\n5%\\n\\n3%\\n\\n1%\\n\\n6.9%\\n\\nSainsbury’s channel performance year-on-year % growth\\nFY2018/19\\n \\n\\nFast Track collection Fast Track delivery\\n\\n16%\\n\\n14%\\n\\n12%\\n\\n10%\\n\\n8%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n2017/18 2018/19\\n\\nArgos Fast Track collection and delivery participation\\n\\n 07Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic R\\neport\\n\\nFinancial Statem\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nQu\\nali\\n\\nty Value\\nSe\\n\\nrv\\nic\\n\\neChoice\\n\\nOur values\\n\\nLogistics\\n\\nChannels\\n\\nSu\\npp\\n\\nly\\n ch\\n\\nain Food\\n\\nG\\neneral Merchandise\\n\\nand Clothing Fina\\nnci\\n\\nal \\nSe\\n\\nrv\\nic\\n\\nes\\n\\nData and \\ninsights\\n\\nOur business model\\nCreates value for our shareholders, customers and colleagues,  \\n\\nboth now and in the future.\\n\\nSupply chain\\nWe source products from over 70 \\ncountries, according to the ability of \\nsuppliers to meet our quality, safety and \\nethical standards.

Quality is a key differentiator \\nfor us. Customers consistently rate the \\nquality of our food as market-leading2 and \\ncontinue to switch to us from more premium \\ncompetitors3. We outperform the market \\nin\\xa0our top tier categories4 such as Taste \\nthe\\xa0Difference, which grew faster than the \\nmarket, with volume growth of 2.2 per cent.\\n\\nOur strength and growth in premium, \\nvalue-added ranges help us to invest in \\nmaking our commodity ranges better value. \\nBut in this highly competitive area, we know \\nwe have more work to do to grow sales. We \\ncontinue to review our ranges to ensure we \\noffer our customers the right combination \\nof\\xa0value and choice. Our cheese category is \\na\\xa0good example of this. By reducing costs \\nin\\xa0our supply chain, we were able to lower \\nprices at the value end of the category, \\nmaking us more competitive on price and \\ndriving volume growth. Together with an \\nimprovement in quality and greater choice \\nat\\xa0the premium end, we improved our \\nmarket share position5 and drove growth \\nin\\xa0cheese volumes of\\xa0six per cent compared \\nto the period before we implemented \\nthe\\xa0changes. \\n\\nQuality is a key differentiator for \\nus and customers consistently \\nrate the quality of our food as \\n\\nmarket-leading.” \\n\\nIn fresh produce, we have worked closely \\nwith suppliers to develop our Ripe & Ready \\nranges. As a result, we have grown volumes \\nby 72 per cent over the last five years, with \\nprices on average 13 per cent lower than the \\nmarket leader in this category.\\n\\nWe are well positioned in a number of \\nhigh\\xa0growth food categories where we can \\nadd\\xa0value for our customers. For example, \\nwe\\xa0have a strong share in the fast-growing \\nvegetarian and vegan markets and we have \\ninvested in new ranges of plant-based meals \\nfor customers who want more alternatives to \\nmeat. Our free-from ranges contribute over \\n£100 million in sales and we outperform the \\ngrowing allergen-free market6. We also \\nincreased volumes in our dairy alternatives \\ncategory by 8.4 per cent and outperformed \\nthe market by offering a wide choice of \\nbranded products.\\n\\nCustomers want distinctive products they \\ncan’t find anywhere else and the number of \\ncustomers who said this was their primary \\nreason for shopping with us increased. Our \\ndedicated Future Brands team works closely \\nwith small, specialist suppliers to bring \\nthese\\xa0innovative and exclusive ranges to our \\ncustomers. We have a longstanding history \\nof working in genuine partnership with our \\nsuppliers and, over the last seven years, they \\nhave consistently ranked us first or second \\nfor supplier relationships in the industry’s \\nlargest independent supplier survey7. We \\nnow have 126 Future Brands in our stores. \\nEvery £1 of profit made from a Future Brand \\nis more than 50p of profit that we would not \\nhave otherwise made.\\n\\nOur strategy is to enable our customers to \\nshop with us whenever and wherever they \\nwant. Our supermarkets are the right size, \\nin\\xa0high quality locations and we continue \\nto\\xa0invest in them. By regularly reviewing \\nour\\xa0ranges, introducing new and exclusive \\nproducts and opening Argos stores in \\nSainsbury’s supermarkets, we have \\nincreased trading intensity in supermarkets. \\nWe have further invested in our store estate \\nby refitting our General Merchandise \\nand\\xa0Tu\\xa0clothing areas and bringing in \\nthe\\xa0right\\xa0ranges to serve local customer \\nneeds.\\xa0We\\xa0will increase investment in \\nour\\xa0supermarkets in 2019/20. \\n\\nWe work with selected concession partners \\nsuch as Sushi Gourmet, Timpsons and \\nSpecsavers so that our customers can do \\nmore of their shopping under one roof. \\nWe\\xa0trialled a major upgrade of our beauty \\nrange in eight stores, with new and exclusive \\nproducts and larger, more inspiring store \\nlayouts. This has proved popular and \\nelements of this will be rolled out further \\nnext year. \\n\\nIn food and grocery, online and convenience \\nsales continue to grow faster than \\nsupermarket sales. Both of these channels \\ncontinue to be strong drivers of profitable \\ngrowth for us.

SmartShop, which allows \\ncustomers to scan their shopping using \\na\\xa0hand-held device or their mobile phone, \\nis\\xa0now available in over 100 supermarkets, \\nhelping customers save time and manage \\ntheir budgets. We introduced SmartShop \\nMobile Pay in eight convenience stores, \\nenabling customers to scan their shopping \\nand pay on their smartphone from anywhere \\nin the store – a first for the UK grocery \\nmarket. Customers who use SmartShop \\nare\\xa0more likely to buy more and to be more \\nloyal to Sainsbury’s.\\n\\nDuring the year we completed the largest \\nreorganisation in our stores for more than \\na\\xa0decade. We made two major changes to \\nthe\\xa0way Sainsbury’s stores operate, to ensure \\nwe are fit for the future and able to adapt to \\nevolving shopping habits. Firstly, we created \\na\\xa0more efficient and effective management \\nstructure which is designed to ensure that \\nour managers are genuinely managing our \\nstores and our colleagues and that our \\ncustomer-facing colleagues have more time \\nto spend with customers on the shop floor. \\nWe also introduced one fair and consistent \\ncolleague contract, which includes greater \\nflexibility, so\\xa0that we can make sure our \\ncolleagues are\\xa0always in the right place \\nat\\xa0the right time for our customers. In \\nrecognition of these changes, we made an \\nindustry-leading investment in colleague \\npay, taking the base rate to £9.20 per hour \\nand bringing the total pay increase to \\n30 per cent over the last four years for \\nSainsbury’s store colleagues. \\n\\nWe have made significant improvements \\nto\\xa0store standards in recent months, which \\nremain a focus. Our new customer feedback \\nservice, Lettuce Know, provides detailed data \\nto each of our stores individually, enabling \\nthem to respond to customer feedback in \\nreal time.

Consideration is given to both reputational as \\nwell as financial impact, recognising the significant commercial \\nvalue of the Sainsbury’s brand. The risk management process is \\naligned to our strategy and each principal risk and uncertainty is \\nconsidered in the context of how it relates to the achievement of \\nthe\\xa0Group’s strategic objectives.\\n\\nOur corporate risk map captures the principal risks to achieving \\nSainsbury’s business objectives. Sainsbury’s Operating Board \\nformally reviews this twice a year. The appetite for each key risk is \\nalso discussed and assessed with a target risk position agreed to \\nreflect the level of risk that the business is willing to accept.

These, together with factors likely to affect its future \\ndevelopment, performance and position are set out in the Strategic \\nReport on pages 1 to 43. The financial position of the Group, its \\ncash\\xa0flows and liquidity are highlighted in the Financial Review on \\npages\\xa038 to 43. The Group manages its financing by diversifying \\nfunding sources, structuring core borrowings with long-term \\nmaturities and maintaining sufficient levels of standby liquidity.\\n\\nThe Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through its corporate \\nplanning process. This includes an annual review which considers \\nprofitability, the Group’s cash flows, committed funding and liquidity \\npositions and forecast future funding requirements over three years, \\nwith a further two years of indicative movements. The most recent \\nwas signed off in November 2018, and refreshed in March 2019 as part \\nof the normal budgeting process. This is reviewed by the Operating \\nBoard and ultimately by the plc Board. Part of the Board’s role is to \\nconsider the appropriateness of any key assumptions, taking into \\naccount the external environment, business strategy and model.\\n\\n2 The assessment period\\nThe Directors have determined that the three years to March 2022 is \\nan appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement. \\nThis period is consistent with that used for the Group’s corporate \\nplanning process as detailed above, and reflects the Directors’ best \\nestimate of the future prospects of the business. \\n\\n3 Assessment of viability\\nTo make the assessment of viability, additional scenarios have \\nbeen\\xa0tested over and above those in the corporate plan, based \\nupon\\xa0a number of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties \\n(as\\xa0documented on pages 30 to 36). The scenarios were overlaid into \\nthe corporate plan to quantify the potential impact of one or more \\nof\\xa0these crystallising over the assessment period.\\n\\nWhilst each of the risks on pages 30 to 36 has a potential impact and \\nhas been considered as part of the assessment, only those that \\nrepresent severe but plausible scenarios were selected for modelling \\nthrough the corporate plan. These were:\\n\\nScenario modelled Link to principal uncertainties\\n\\nScenario 1\\nCompetitive price cutting/price matching\\nGiven the challenging trading environment, driven by ongoing competitive retail pricing combined with growing inflationary cost pressures, \\nadditional price investment of £150 million per year has been modelled in each of the three assessment years. \\n\\n — Trading environment and competitive \\nlandscape\\n\\nScenario 2\\nData breaches\\nThe impact of any regulatory fines has been considered. The biggest of these is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fine for data \\nbreaches, which was enacted in May 2018. Fines were considered both in isolation, and in conjunction with a fall in sales volumes as a result \\nof any reputational brand damage in each of the assessment years.\\n\\n — Data security\\n\\nScenario 3\\nLegal breaches\\nSimilar to the above, we considered the reputational impact of any legal or health and safety incidents, modelling a fall in sales volumes \\nin each year of the assessment period. Falls in sales volumes were modelled in each year in isolation, as well as a sustained year-on-year \\ntwo per cent reduction. We also considered regulatory fines such as those levied by the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP).\\n\\n — Health and safety, people and product\\n — Political and regulatory environment\\n\\nScenario 4\\nUK’s withdrawal from the EU\\nUncertainty around the UK’s future relationship with the EU restricts the Group’s ability to fully mitigate risks for customers, suppliers and \\ncolleagues. The impacts of a range of outcomes have been modelled and considered jointly on a reasonable worst case basis. Modelling \\nhas taken account of the likely disruption of goods entering the UK, sales reductions, margin pressures resulting from tariff increases, \\noperational and labour cost increases and small supplier working capital considerations. \\n\\n — Financial and treasury risk\\n — Brexit\\n\\nScenario 5\\nIt was considered what level of sustained loss would be required in Sainsbury’s Bank before its capital ratios were breached.  — Sainsbury’s Bank\\n\\nScenario 6\\nFailure to deliver sustainable cost savings\\nThe Group Corporate Plan assumes savings of £500 million over the next three years. A scenario has therefore been modelled in which all \\nplanned savings/synergies are not fully realised.\\n\\n — Business strategy and change\\n\\nA number of borrowing facilities mature during the three-year \\nassessment period, including the £200 million bank loan due in 2019 \\nand the first tranche of the revolving credit facility of £300 million \\n(see note 28 to the accounts). The Group’s £450 million convertible \\nbonds also mature in 2019. In performing the above analysis, the \\nDirectors have made certain assumptions around the availability \\nof future funding options and the ability to raise future finance. \\nIn doing so a variety of viable and scalable options available to \\nrefinance the upcoming maturities over the assessment period \\nhave been considered, with a prudent view taken that 50 per cent \\nof these could be raised over the assessment period. \\n\\nThe scenarios above are hypothetical and severe for the purpose of \\ncreating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of \\nthe\\xa0Group; however, multiple control measures are in place to prevent \\nand mitigate any such occurrences from taking place. In the case \\nof\\xa0these scenarios arising, various options are available to the \\nGroup in order to maintain liquidity so as to continue in operation. \\n\\nThese include reducing any non-essential capital expenditure \\nand operating expenditure on projects, bonuses, as well as not \\npaying dividends.\\n\\nThe results of the above stress testing showed that the Group would \\nbe able to withstand the impact of these scenarios occurring over the \\nassessment period.\\n\\n4 Viability statement\\nTaking into account the Group’s current position and principal risks \\nand uncertainties, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable \\nexpectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and \\nmeet its liabilities as they fall due over the three years to March 2022.\\n\\n5 Going concern\\nThe Directors also considered it appropriate to adopt the going \\nconcern basis in preparing the financial statements which are shown \\non pages 89 to 188.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancial Review\\n2018/19 has been another year of progress \\n\\nagainst our strategic priorities which saw us \\ndeliver strong growth in underlying profit and \\n\\nretail free cash flow and a reduction in net debt \\nahead of expectations. During the year we \\n\\ncompleted the Argos integration programme \\nand delivered the target synergies nine months \\n\\nahead of schedule, consolidated the Nectar \\nbusiness following the acquisition in 2017/18 \\nand completed a significant management \\n\\nreorganisation in Sainsbury’s stores.\\n\\nIn a highly competitive market Sainsbury’s underlying Group sales \\n(including VAT) were up 2.1 per cent to £32,412 million. On a 52-week rolling \\nbasis Sainsbury’s grocery market share (as measured by Kantar) declined \\n37 basis points, with the discounters and Co-op gaining share from the rest \\nof the market largely as a result of new store openings. Argos sales grew, \\noutperforming a declining and highly competitive general merchandise \\nmarket (as measured by the British Retail Consortium, ‘BRC’). Tu clothing \\nheld share as sales declined in line with the market whilst full price sales \\nincreased as a result of reduced promotional activity.\\n\\nIn 2018/19, retail underlying EBITDAR margin increased eight basis points to \\n7.52 per cent and retail underlying operating margin improved 19 basis points \\nto 2.43 per cent. Underlying profit before tax (UPBT) increased by 7.8 per \\ncent to £635 million (2017/18: £589 million) driven by strong retail underlying \\nprofit growth and reduced interest costs, partly offset by lower Financial \\nServices profit. Profit after tax of £219 million (2017/18: £309 million) was \\ndown 29.1 per cent as a result of a £396 million charge recognised outside of \\nunderlying profit. This charge includes the restructuring charge for changes \\nto Sainsbury’s store operations implemented during the year, the final Argos \\nintegration costs, Sainsbury’s Bank transition costs, Asda transaction costs \\nand a £98 million pension provision following the guaranteed minimum \\npensions ruling. \\n\\n£220 million of cost savings were delivered during the year to offset the \\nimpact of cost inflation and the increase in Sainsbury’s colleague base rate \\nof pay to a market leading £9.20 per hour. We have well developed plans in \\nplace to continue to deliver efficiencies to offset cost inflation in future years.\\n\\nFinancial Services underlying operating profits decreased to £31 million, \\nas guided in May 2018 (2017/18: £69 million), primarily due to additional bad \\ndebt charges following the adoption of IFRS 9 as well as a more cautious \\napproach to unsecured lending and higher costs. We have focused on \\ngrowing our mortgage book and commission products and have seen Bank \\ncustomer numbers grow by five per cent and customer lending increase \\nby £1.3 billion, driven mainly by mortgage balance growth. Argos Financial \\nServices customer numbers increased by six per cent. \\n\\nThe balance sheet remains strong with a further reduction in net debt. Net \\ndebt (including perpetual securities) was £1,636 million as at 9 March 2019 \\n(10 March 2018: £1,858 million), a total decrease of £222 million in the year \\nand a decrease of £162 million before fair value movements on derivatives, \\nahead of our guidance of £100 million reduction. The business generated \\nretail free cash flow of £461 million which resulted in a dividend cash cover \\nof 2.1. We will remain disciplined and focused on cash management, taking \\naction to reduce net debt. We are aiming to reduce net debt by at least a \\nfurther £600 million over the next three years. The Group has facilities of \\n£3.6 billion with only £2.1 billion drawn at the end of the year. \\n\\nThe Group pension scheme IAS 19 accounting surplus (net of deferred tax) \\nhas improved to £743 million (2017/18: £261 million deficit) as at 9 March 2019 \\nas a result of both experience and actuarial gains in relation to changes in \\nmortality assumptions.\\n\\nUnderlying basic earnings per share increased 7.8 per cent to 22.0 pence \\n(2017/18: 20.4 pence). Basic earnings per share decreased 31.6 per cent to \\n9.1 pence (2017/18: 13.3 pence) due to the £396 million charge recognised \\noutside of underlying results. \\n\\nThe Board has recommended a final dividend of 7.9 pence (2017/18: \\n7.1 pence), resulting in a full-year dividend of 11.0 pence per share (2017/18: \\n10.2 pence per share), an increase of 7.8 per cent.\\n\\nKevin O’Byrne\\nChief Financial Officer\\n\\n38 Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary income statement \\n\\n52 weeks to\\n9 March 2019\\n\\n£m\\n\\n52 weeks to \\n10 March 2018\\n\\n£m\\nChange \\n\\n%\\n\\nUnderlying Group sales (including VAT) 32,412 31,735 2.1 \\nUnderlying Retail sales (including VAT) 31,871 31,220 2.1 \\nUnderlying Group sales (excluding VAT)1 29,007 28,453 1.9 \\nUnderlying Retail sales (excluding VAT)2 28,466 27,938 1.9 \\nUnderlying operating profit    \\nRetail 692 625 10.7 \\nFinancial Services 31 69 (55.1)\\nTotal underlying operating profit 723 694 4.2 \\nUnderlying net finance costs3 (96) (119) 19.3 \\nUnderlying share of post-tax profit from JVs4 8 14 (42.9)\\nUnderlying profit before tax 635 589 7.8 \\nItems excluded from underlying results (396) (180) (120.0)\\nProfit before tax 239 409 (41.6)\\nIncome tax expense (20) (100) 80.0\\nProfit for the financial period 219 309 (29.1)\\nUnderlying basic earnings per share 22.0p 20.4p 7.8 \\nBasic earnings per share 9.1p 13.3p (31.6)\\nDividend per share 11.0p 10.2p 7.8 \\n\\n1 2017/18 underlying Group revenue of £28,459 million, disclosed in note 4 of the accounts, includes £6 million of revenue consolidated post the acquisition of Nectar that is excluded from the underlying \\nGroup sales.\\n\\n2 2017/18 underlying retail revenue of £27,944 million, disclosed in note 4 of the accounts, includes £6 million of revenue consolidated post the acquisition of Nectar that is excluded from the underlying \\nretail sales.\\n\\n3 Net finance costs including perpetual securities coupons before non-underlying finance movements.\\n4  The underlying share of post-tax profit from joint ventures and associates (JVs) is stated before investment property fair value movements, non-underlying finance movements and profit on \\n\\ndisposal of properties.\\n\\nGroup sales\\nUnderlying Group sales (including VAT, including fuel) increased by 2.1 per \\ncent year-on-year.

The \\nnumber of active Bank customers increased by five per cent year-on-year to \\n2.02 million (2017/18: 1.92 million).\\n\\nNet interest margin decreased by 110 basis points year-on-year to 3.8 per \\ncent (2017/18: 4.9 per cent) driven by margin pressure and mix of business. \\nThis was largely due to the launch of mortgages and the issuance of Tier 2 \\nloan notes in 2017/18. Bad debt levels as a percentage of lending increased \\nto 1.6 per cent (2017/18: 1.3 per cent) primarily driven by the impact of IFRS \\n9 on the bad debt charge. However underlying arrears remain low relative to \\ncompetitors and have remained stable year-on-year. \\n\\nThe CET 1 capital ratio decreased by 40 basis points year-on-year to  \\n13.7 per cent (2017/18: 14.1 per cent), reflecting lending growth partially  \\noffset by the effect of additional funds contributed from the Parent in the \\nprior financial year. \\n\\nCustomer lending increased by 23 per cent to £6,987 million, mainly due \\nto growth in mortgages which were launched in 2017. Customer deposits \\nincreased by 19 per cent to £5,950 million.\\n\\nTransition costs of £70 million were £10 million lower than previous guidance \\nof £80 million. Sainsbury’s Bank transition costs in 2019/20 are expected to \\nbe around £30 million, £10 million of which is a result of the underspend in \\n2018/19.\\n\\nFinancial Services underlying operating profit is expected to be around £45 \\nmillion in 2019/20, including a £10 million benefit as a result of a change in \\ntransfer pricing between Argos and Argos Financial Services.\\n\\nCapital injections into the Bank are expected to be £80 million in 2019/20. \\nThis is to cover card and loan platforms, regulatory capital and growth in \\nloan, card and mortgage balances.\\n\\nUnderlying net finance costs\\nUnderlying net finance costs reduced by 19 per cent to £96 million (2017/18: \\n£119 million), driven by the £568 million repayment in April 2018 of the \\nsecuritised loan taken out in 2006.\\n\\nSainsbury’s expects net finance costs in 2019/20 to be in line with 2018/19.\\n\\nJoint ventures\\nShare of underlying profit from joint ventures was £8 million (2017/18: £14 \\nmillion).

This includes a prior year \\ndeferred tax credit of £50 million arising on the recognition of a previously \\nunrecognised capital loss. \\n\\nIn 2019/20, Sainsbury’s expects the full-year underlying tax rate to be around \\n24 per cent.\\n\\nEarnings per share\\nUnderlying basic earnings per share increased to 22.0 pence (2017/18: \\n20.4 pence) driven by the increase in underlying earnings year-on-year. \\nBasic earnings per share decreased to 9.1 pence (2017/18: 13.3 pence), mainly \\nas a result of the £396 million charge for items excluded from underlying \\nresults (2017/18: £180 million charge), offset by a lower effective tax rate. \\n\\nDividends\\nThe Board has recommended a final dividend of 7.9 pence per share (2017/18: \\n7.1 pence). This will be paid on 12 July 2019 to shareholders on the Register \\nof Members at the close of business on 7 June 2019.

Working capital increased by £45 million (2017/18: £196 \\nmillion decrease). Capital expenditure before strategic capital expenditure \\nwas £512 million (2017/18: £542 million) driven by a reduction in Sainsbury’s \\ncore retail capital expenditure.

Free cash flow was used to fund dividends and repay \\ndebt. Dividends of £224 million were paid in the year, which are covered 2.1 \\ntimes by free cash flow (2017/18: 2.0 times). Strategic capital expenditure, \\nrelating to Argos integration capital expenditure was £36 million, £44 million \\nlower year-on-year (2017/18: £80 million) driven by the completion of the \\nArgos integration programme.\\n\\nNet debt before fair value movements on derivatives reduced by £162 million \\nin the year (2017/18: £236 million reduction). Fair value movements on \\nderivatives of £60 million were primarily driven by an increase in the value of \\nUS dollar foreign exchange derivatives held to mitigate the Group’s exposure \\nto fluctuations in US dollar denominated purchases. The weighted average \\nhedge rate (WAHR) at 9 March 2019 was above the spot rate, generating an \\nunrealised fair value gain (2017/18: unrealised loss as the WAHR at 10 March \\n2018 was below the spot rate).\\n\\nAs at 9 March 2019, Sainsbury’s had drawn debt facilities of £2.1 billion \\nincluding the perpetual securities (2017/18: £2.5 billion) and additional \\nundrawn committed credit facilities of £1.4 billion.

The following paragraphs add detail on some of the specific \\npriorities and meetings.\\n\\nStrategy conference\\nIn October, a two-day conference for the Board and Operating Board was \\nheld, providing a key opportunity for an in-depth review of our strategy. \\nThe\\xa0focus of the conference was on the retail landscape, consumers’ \\nchanging shopping habits, our competitors, the proposed merger with \\nAsda,\\xa0the Group’s digital vision and the five-year corporate plan. The \\nconference was carefully structured to give the Board time to debate \\nand\\xa0challenge and to discuss the views of external analysts and investors. \\nExternal advisers attended for part of the conference.\\n\\nIn-depth reviews and meeting the wider management team\\nThe Board strongly believes that it is important to focus on key areas \\nof\\xa0the\\xa0Group’s strategy and to get to know the wider senior management \\nteam. During the year there were a number of opportunities for these \\nkey\\xa0activities.\\n\\nThe Board looked closely at the impact on Sainsbury’s store colleagues \\nwhen\\xa0agreeing the introduction of a single, fair and consistent colleague \\ncontract. In June the Board members discussed the colleague consultation \\nprocess and\\xa0reviewed the latest ‘We’re Listening’ survey results, which \\nreflect\\xa0the\\xa0feedback of every colleague on key engagement metrics. They \\nhave also\\xa0been updated regularly on customer insights and certain aspects \\nof\\xa0supplier relationships. \\n\\nTechnology plays an increasingly important role in our customers’ lives \\nand\\xa0the Board regularly monitors our progress in developing our digital \\noffer\\xa0across the business. During the year they undertook an in-depth \\nreview\\xa0of\\xa0our current strategy and explored how the digital ecosystem \\ncould\\xa0be developed in each part of the business.\\n\\nThe Board regularly holds meetings in different business locations in order \\nto\\xa0meet management teams and colleagues, review performance, discuss \\nprogress and agree key priorities for the short and medium term: \\n\\nSainsbury’s Redhill Store, June 2018\\nThis gave the Board members the opportunity to discuss strategy with the \\nFood Management Board. They toured the store, which reopened earlier \\nin\\xa0the\\xa0year following a major redevelopment, and covered areas such as \\nnew\\xa0business relationships, concessions, the opening of Argos stores in \\nSainsbury’s supermarkets and the digital offer for customers and future \\npriorities. The Board was updated on the introduction of a single, fair and \\nconsistent contract for all Sainsbury’s store colleagues and the creation \\nof\\xa0an\\xa0efficient and effective management structure. \\n\\nSainsbury’s Bank Head Office, Edinburgh, September 2018\\nThe Board met the Bank’s wider management team and discussed strategy \\nin depth. There were presentations on a range of subjects including digital, \\nmarketing, colleague engagement and Group interaction.\\n\\nArgos Regional Fulfilment Centre, Croydon, January 2019\\nSainsbury’s Argos Management Board updated the Board on the Argos \\nbusiness including an overview of the Argos distribution model and its plans \\nfor 2019/20. This was followed by a tour of the newly opened Fulfilment \\nCentre in Croydon.\\n\\nBuilding up knowledge of the Group is an ongoing process for the Board \\nand\\xa0will continue in 2019/20.

Martin visited our major business locations at Sainsbury’s Argos in \\nMilton Keynes, Sainsbury’s Food Online Fulfilment Centre in Bromley-by-Bow \\nas well as stores, distribution centres and Sainsbury’s Archive. He attended \\nthe Group Strategy Conference, and the Audit and Remuneration Committee \\nmeetings as an observer. He also met with principal shareholders and key \\nadvisers.

Other examples of continuing engagement \\nwith different aspects of the business are described below. \\n\\nJo Harlow joined the Board in September 2017 and became the new Chair of \\nthe Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee from May\\xa02018. \\nIn that capacity, she has built her understanding by visiting Sainsbury’s \\nsuppliers. She also attended the Sainsbury’s Farming Conference and \\npre-conference event to strengthen her understanding of the topical issues \\nfacing Sainsbury’s supplier base, with a particular focus on sustainability. \\nShe met with the Chair and leaders of The Woodland Trust and discussed \\nthe\\xa0current state of and opportunities for our long-term partnership with \\nthem. With the Board’s focus on culture and stakeholder engagement, \\n\\nshe\\xa0participated in the London School of Economics event on Sainsbury’s \\napproach to culture and engagement and met with Sainsbury’s colleagues at \\nboth a ‘Talking Shop’ event in Bristol and a listening session with Great Place \\nto Work representatives. She continued to enhance her understanding of our \\nbusiness by meeting with senior leaders in our Food and Grocery business, \\nSainsbury’s Argos, General Merchandise and Clothing, and Sainsbury’s Bank.\\n\\nAs Audit Committee Chair, David Keens continued his oversight by meeting \\nwith teams across Group Finance to discuss aspects of internal controls. He \\nreviewed business areas such as insurance, treasury funding and hedging \\nwith our internal audit team. He also attended disaster recovery tests of \\nSainsbury’s Argos’ systems in Coventry and held meetings with the Groceries \\nSupplier Code Adjudicator.\\n\\n 53Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance R\\n\\neport\\nStrategic Report\\n\\nFinancial Statem\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional development and training\\nTo ensure the Board updates and refreshes their skills and knowledge, \\nwe\\xa0have a programme to support Directors’ training and development \\nrequirements in relation to governance, investor expectations and regulatory \\nimpacts. This includes regular presentations from management on relevant \\ngovernance matters. Both the Audit and Remuneration Committees received \\nupdates on relevant accounting and remuneration developments, trends and \\nchanging disclosure requirements from external advisers and management, \\nand the Board received an update on the 2018 UK Corporate Governance \\nCode. The Directors also had access to the advice of the Company Secretary \\nand independent professional advice is available at the Company’s expense, \\nif necessary, in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities.\\n\\nDirector independence \\nThe Chairman satisfied the independence criteria of the 2016 Code on his \\nappointment to the Board and all the Non-Executive Directors are considered \\nto be independent. The independence of the Non-Executive Directors is closely \\nmonitored by the Board and formed part of the Board effectiveness review. \\n\\nTime commitment and conflicts of interest\\nPrior to appointment, each prospective Non-Executive Director confirms \\nthat\\xa0they will have sufficient time available to be able to discharge their \\nresponsibilities effectively and that they have no conflicts of interest, and \\nthis is discussed by the Board before any appointment is made. In addition, \\nthe Board reviews, in advance, requests by Directors wishing to undertake \\nnew responsibilities or directorships and considers both the time \\ncommitments involved and any potential conflicts. There is also an annual \\nreview of the conflicts of interest register to ensure it is up to date and that \\nthere are no new conflicts to review. No changes were recorded during the \\nyear which would impact the independence of any of the Directors. \\n\\nThe Board supports Executive Directors having a non-executive directorship \\nas part of their continuing development provided they have sufficient time \\nto balance their commitments to the Group with any external role. Subject \\nto\\xa0Board approval, each Executive Director may have one non-executive \\ndirector position. Whilst recognising the benefits of Non-Executive Directors \\nhaving varied and broad experiences, the Board keeps in mind investor \\nguidance and reviews the commitments of each Director annually. \\nThroughout the year, all Directors have good attendance records at scheduled \\nmeetings, and demonstrated high levels of availability and responsiveness \\nfor additional meetings and discussions where these have been required. \\nThe\\xa0Board remains confident that individual members continue to devote \\nsufficient time to undertake their responsibilities effectively. \\n\\nBoard evaluation \\nWe review our effectiveness as a Board on an annual basis, including an \\nassessment of the Board and its Committees. The last external evaluation \\nwas carried out by Manchester Square Partners in 2016/17. The 2018/19 \\ninternal review was led by the Company Secretary and Corporate Services \\nDirector, Tim Fallowfield.\\n\\nThe review was conducted from December 2018 to February 2019 and \\ncontinued to explore the themes that were raised for action in the 2017/18 \\nreview. Board members completed a questionnaire, based on last year’s \\nin\\xa0order to be able to maintain continuity, which also incorporated recent \\ndevelopments in the business, strategy and governance practice. The Board \\nreviewed its key decision-making processes during the year, particularly \\nrelating to the appointment of the new Chairman and the decision to \\nmerge\\xa0with Asda. The Board also assessed its culture and engagement \\nwith\\xa0stakeholders in line with the 2018 Code. Individual discussions were \\nsubsequently held with all Directors. The Company Secretary discussed the \\nconclusions with the serving Chairman, David Tyler, and presented them to \\nthe Board. The Board discussed the key\\xa0points and agreed certain actions. \\n\\nFindings of the 2018/19 review\\nThe Board concluded that it performs effectively and is well placed to lead \\nthe Company at a time of considerable change in the sector. There was \\nstrong alignment amongst the Directors on the key strategic issues facing \\nthe Group. The following were seen as particular strengths of the Board:\\n\\n — Focus, shared understanding and purpose\\n — Board diversity \\n — Culture of openness and debate\\n — Chairman’s leadership of the Board\\n — Group Chief Executive Officer’s leadership\\n — Decision-making in key business projects\\n — Executive response to challenge by the Non-Executive Directors\\n — Strategic debate and engagement\\n — Risk management\\n\\nThe progress and actions can be found in the table on page 55.\\n\\n54 Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nKey areas of focus from 2017/18 review Progress and actions implemented during 2018/19 Agreed actions for 2019/20\\n\\nCulture and stakeholder engagement\\nWhilst the Board and Committees were fully engaged with \\nthe Group’s strong values and culture, the Board felt that \\nit\\xa0would benefit from an in-depth session to pull all aspects \\nof culture together with particular emphasis on colleague \\nfeedback and metrics.\\n\\nIn addition, it would strengthen engagement with colleagues \\nby meeting with the Great Place to Work Group twice a year \\nto share some of the Board’s priorities and to hear what the \\nkey issues are for colleagues. Non-Executive Directors would \\nalso be invited to the ‘Talking Shop’ sessions that Operating \\nBoard Directors hold with colleague groups. Other stakeholder \\nengagement would continue to be reported to the Board on \\na\\xa0regular basis.\\n\\nThe Board felt that good progress was being made on \\nmany\\xa0aspects of engagement and it now has a deeper \\nunderstanding of the Group’s values and culture. \\n\\nThe Board’s activities on culture and engagement during \\nthe\\xa0year are set out on pages 56 and 57.\\n\\nContinue to build on the current activities and the Board \\nagenda to maintain oversight of the Group’s culture \\nand\\xa0to further engage with stakeholders.\\n\\nDetermine the preferred method of engaging with \\ncolleagues, to comply with the 2018 Code, by learning \\nmore from the range of activities planned for the year.\\n\\nBusiness performance and strategic priorities\\nIn order to ensure the Board continues to provide \\nappropriate\\xa0oversight of the performance of each of the \\nGroup businesses, it would continue to focus on the KPIs \\nby\\xa0reviewing analyst reports and taking a broad perspective \\non\\xa0the future of the sector. This would enable the Board \\nto\\xa0ensure that the KPIs reflect the key drivers of business \\nperformance in the sector going forward.\\n\\nThe Board focusses on key business performance indicators \\nand reviews the retail market at each meeting. Strategic \\nin-depth reviews enable the Board to review emerging \\ntrends\\xa0in detail. \\n\\nAt the annual Strategy Conference, the Board had in-depth \\ndiscussions on the industry background, consumers’ \\nchanging shopping habits and competitors, and considered \\nthe views of external analysts and investors.\\n\\nIn a fast moving sector, the Board agreed to continue \\nto\\xa0focus on the KPIs of each business unit and the Group \\nin the overall market, and to hold detailed discussions \\nabout the context and drivers of trading performance \\nand value creation.\\n\\nData security (new) The Board felt that oversight of, and assurance over, \\nthe\\xa0Group’s plans and priorities for information security \\nand\\xa0data governance had progressed during the year, \\nparticularly as a result of the additional review sessions \\nby the Audit Committee.

Various aspects of culture have \\nbeen considered by the Board and\\xa0Committees \\nthrough the scheduled cycle of meetings for \\nmany years, supplemented by other engagement \\nopportunities on an increasing basis. \\n\\nThe Board agreed in the 2017/18 Board evaluation \\nexercise to conduct an annual review of the \\nGroup’s culture and to expand its engagement \\nwith stakeholders, particularly with colleagues, \\nin\\xa0a year of significant change in the supermarket \\nestate with the introduction of a single, fair and \\nconsistent contract for all Sainsbury’s store \\ncolleagues and the creation of an efficient and \\neffective management structure.

These reviews have \\ncontinued at subsequent Board and Committee \\nmeetings, supplemented by formal and informal \\nmeetings between the Board and colleagues and \\nother regular updates on stakeholder \\nengagement.\\n\\n See more about our values on pages 18 to 27. \\n\\nShareholders\\nEngagement with our institutional investors \\nand\\xa0private shareholders is an ongoing process. \\nWe\\xa0connect with them through a variety of \\nchannels\\xa0including face-to-face meetings, \\nwebcasts\\xa0and online.\\n\\nInstitutional investors\\nShareholder contact is the responsibility of Mike Coupe, \\nKevin O’Byrne and the Head of Investor Relations. \\nDavid\\xa0Tyler met with institutional shareholders and \\nother large investors during the year, and Martin Scicluna \\nhas met key shareholders as part of his induction. \\nAs\\xa0well as meeting with institutional shareholders and \\nother large investors, senior management also met with \\nsell-side research analysts, through regular post-results \\nroadshows, ad-hoc meetings, conference attendances \\nand site visits in the UK, US and\\xa0Europe. A total of 192 \\nshareholders and potential investors were met with in \\n182 meetings over the course of\\xa0the year. Investors and \\nanalysts are also invited to participate in conference \\ncalls and presentations which are webcast and posted \\non our website, making them available to all investors.\\n\\nInvestor tours\\nIn 2018/19, institutional investors and analysts were \\ninvited to our new Sainsbury’s store in Redhill and \\nto\\xa0visit our fruit supplier in Kent, to help them gain \\na\\xa0greater understanding of our Food business and \\nsustainability within agricultural supply chains. \\nTheir\\xa0views were fed back to the Board at subsequent \\nBoard meetings.\\n\\nInvestor perception study\\nThe views of analysts and major investors are fed back \\nto the Board on a regular basis. Once a year they receive \\nan independent report from corporate advisory firm \\nMakinson Cowell on major investor views, share price \\nperformance, the share register, and the Investor \\nRelations programme. This allows the Board to monitor \\nperformance and increase focus in certain areas.\\n\\nAnnual General Meeting\\nThe Annual General Meeting provides the Board with \\nthe\\xa0opportunity to communicate with private and \\ninstitutional investors and we encourage their \\nparticipation at the meeting. Mike Coupe provides an \\nupdate on the business performance and shareholders \\nhave the opportunity to meet and question the Board. \\nThis provides the Board with valuable feedback and \\nhelps them to understand the views of shareholders.\\n\\nColleagues\\nThe Board is committed to making Sainsbury’s \\na\\xa0great place to work. Initiatives such as ‘Great \\nPlace to Work’ groups, ‘Talking Shop’ colleague \\nlistening sessions, our ‘Yammer’ social network \\nsite\\xa0and regular store-based colleague meetings \\nare all used\\xa0to understand how colleagues are \\nfeeling. Identifying our colleagues’ engagement \\nlevels is\\xa0at\\xa0the heart of how we continuously \\nimprove, adapt and evolve our culture. The \\nfeedback is shared\\xa0with\\xa0the Board and \\nCommittees in various ways described below.\\n\\nGreat Place to Work Groups \\nOur Great Place to Work Groups are made up of \\ncolleagues across the business elected by their peers to \\nrepresent their\\xa0views at meetings held on a regular basis \\nto discuss diverse issues. Each store has its own group. \\nThis network reviewed and supported the introduction \\nof a single, fair and consistent contract for all \\nSainsbury’s store colleagues and was an important \\nsource of communication and feedback. In September, \\nDavid Tyler and Jo Harlow met with our national Great \\nPlace to Work Group to hear their feedback on\\xa0the major \\nchange programme taking place in Sainsbury’s stores, \\nand their views on the proposed merger with Asda. \\nDavid Tyler and Jo Harlow found the meeting very \\ninformative and\\xa0shared the key points with the Board \\nat\\xa0its\\xa0next meeting. Susan Rice and Martin Scicluna will \\nattend the\\xa0next Great Place to Work meeting in May 2019.\\n\\n‘Talking Shop’ listening sessions\\nThese question-and-answer style listening sessions give \\nstore colleagues the opportunity to meet members of \\nthe Operating Board and discuss the issues that affect \\nthem. This year, Matt Brittin, Susan Rice and Jo Harlow \\neach attended a ‘Talking Shop’ session with around 20 \\ncolleagues, representing each store in different regions, \\ngiving them the opportunity to hear, first-hand, how \\ncolleagues were feeling and what was on their minds. \\n\\nWe’re Listening survey\\nWe’re Listening is our annual colleague engagement \\nsurvey that invites every colleague from across our \\nbusiness to give honest feedback on what it’s like to \\nwork for the Sainsbury’s Group. The results of the \\nconfidential survey enable managers to produce local \\naction plans designed to make their part of the business \\nan even greater place to work. The\\xa0survey results were \\npresented to the Board during their review of culture in \\nJune, giving them insights into colleague engagement \\nfollowing the introduction of a single, fair and consistent \\ncontract for all Sainsbury’s store colleagues and the \\ncreation of an efficient and effective management \\nstructure. Further information can be found on page 52.\\n\\nColleague pay and recognition\\nThe Remuneration Committee regularly reviews pay \\nthroughout the business in fulfilling its oversight role. \\nOur\\xa0colleague recognition schemes are an important \\nway of\\xa0rewarding colleagues who live our values. \\nThe\\xa0Board discussed the re-launched recognition \\nprogramme at its\\xa0June review.\\n\\nInclusion\\nInclusion is regularly discussed at Board and \\nCommittee\\xa0meetings.

The Foundation \\nfocuses our resources on activities that will drive \\nprogress in the social, economic and environmental \\nsustainability of farmers and workers and communities \\nwithin our global supply chains. The Advisory Board’s \\nfirst mandate was to oversee the Sainsbury’s Fairly \\nTraded tea pilot scheme. Regular updates on progress \\nwere provided to the CR&S Committee.

The Board considered the \\nimpact of the proposed merger on all \\nstakeholders and described how it \\nwould deliver a great deal for customers, \\ncolleagues, suppliers and shareholders \\nof both businesses in the public \\ndocuments relating to it. As explained \\non this page, the Board received regular \\nupdates on the implementation of the \\nchange programme in Sainsbury’s \\nstores\\xa0including feedback from affected \\ncolleagues.\\n\\n2018 UK Corporate \\nGovernance Code\\nThe new 2018 Code recommends that \\ncompanies should establish a method \\nfor gathering the view of the workforce \\nand suggests one of three options. The \\nBoard currently shares this responsibility \\namongst the Non-Executive Directors so \\nthat each is able to benefit directly from \\nhearing colleague feedback, for instance, \\nthrough attendance at Great Place to \\nWork and ‘Talking Shop’ meetings. \\nHowever, it will continue to keep under \\nreview whether to continue this \\napproach or if a\\xa0designated Non-\\nExecutive Director should lead on \\ncolleague engagement.\\n\\n 57Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance R\\n\\neport\\nStrategic Report\\n\\nFinancial Statem\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nNomination \\nCommittee \\n\\nReport\\nDear Shareholder\\n\\nThis has been a busy year for the Committee, \\nwith our particular focus on appointing a new \\nChairman to succeed David Tyler, in addition \\nto our usual programme overseeing talent, \\n\\nsuccession, diversity and inclusion.\\n\\nPrincipal role and responsibilities\\nThe responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include reviewing \\nthe balance of skills, knowledge, experience, independence and diversity \\nof the Board and its Committees, and making recommendations \\nto\\xa0the Board for any changes. It is responsible for formulating plans \\nfor\\xa0succession at Board and senior management levels, taking into \\naccount the challenges and opportunities facing the Company, and \\nthe skills and expertise needed to ensure the long-term success of \\nthe\\xa0Group. \\n\\nThe Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the Company’s \\nwebsite www.about.sainsburys.co.uk.\\n\\nWe announced in April 2018 that we had started the Chairman succession \\nprocess, which I led with the Nomination Committee, in my role as Senior \\nIndependent Director. We conducted a comprehensive search, in line with \\nbest practice, which led to the appointment of Martin Scicluna. This is \\ndescribed in detail later in this report.\\n\\nThe Committee’s other priorities are to monitor our succession plans at Board, \\nOperating Board and senior management level, review our progress on \\nbecoming a more diverse and inclusive business and oversee the Group’s \\napproach to resourcing the needs of the business, developing our colleagues \\nand recruiting new talent. When the Board reviews the Group’s strategy \\nin\\xa0October, we take the opportunity to have a comprehensive update from \\nAngie Risley, our Group HR Director, and Mike Coupe on each of these \\nimportant matters. \\n\\nIn a year of significant structural change, we are pleased that our senior \\nleadership team has been stable and we are confident in the calibre of \\nour\\xa0management team. Appointments have been made throughout the \\nbusiness to support the delivery of our strategy, and our internal pipeline \\nhas\\xa0further improved over the last year as a result of external recruitment \\nand internal promotion. \\n\\nThe Board recognises the benefits of diversity, both on the Board and \\nthroughout the business, as part of the Company’s objective of being \\n‘the\\xa0most inclusive retailer where people love to work and shop’. This is a key \\npart of the Board and Committees’ agendas, and at our October meeting \\nwe\\xa0reviewed our progress in making the business more inclusive across each \\nof our four inclusion streams of gender, ethnicity, LGBT and disability/carers. \\nWe reviewed the long list of actions that have been implemented to date \\nand\\xa0the opportunities for the year ahead, and are pleased to see that the \\ngender and ethnicity balance of our senior population has improved year \\non\\xa0year. The promotion of Clodagh Moriarty as Group Digital Director in \\nJune\\xa02018 improved gender diversity on our Operating Board. We can also \\nsee that there is a strong list of activities to create a diverse pipeline of talent \\nthroughout the business, for both the shorter and longer term.\\n\\nAs part of the Board evaluation exercise, we reviewed the Committee’s \\neffectiveness. The Board considers that the Committee continues to be \\neffective in its role of supporting the Board, and that the search for a new \\nChairman led to a very satisfactory outcome. \\n\\nWe were delighted to appoint Martin Scicluna as our new Chairman. He \\nbrings a wealth of experience and leadership to the Group at a pivotal time. \\nHe joined the Board as Chairman Designate and Non-Executive Director in \\nNovember and has worked closely with the outgoing Chairman, David Tyler, \\nthe Board and the senior management team to ensure a smooth transition. \\nHe became Chairman on the first day of the 2019/20 financial year.

Martin Scicluna’s recruitment was \\nfacilitated by Egon Zehnder, an independent executive search consultant \\nwhich has no connection to the Company other than in assisting and \\nfacilitating in the search for senior management. The Committee held a \\nnumber of additional unscheduled meetings as part of the appointment \\nprocess as\\xa0set out below:\\n\\nIdentify\\nWith a detailed understanding of what was required \\nfor the role, Egon Zehnder identified an extensive \\nand diverse list of potential candidates who were \\nappraised by the Senior Independent Director \\nagainst the agreed brief, key competencies and \\nexperience required for the role. This created a \\nlong\\xa0list which was reviewed by the Committee to \\nproduce a shortlist. The agreed brief included key \\nattributes such as previous experience, cultural fit, \\nmanaging complex shareholder relationships, and \\ndriving transformation. \\n\\nInterview\\nThe shortlisted candidates were interviewed by \\nthe\\xa0Senior\\xa0Independent Director and Group Chief \\nExecutive Officer and timings of the appointment \\nand handover of\\xa0the role were discussed. The \\npreferred candidates met\\xa0with all Non-Executive \\nDirectors, after which the Board and Nomination \\nCommittee members met to discuss feedback.\\n\\nSelect\\nPrior to the final selection and appointment, the \\nSenior Independent Director obtained references \\nfrom key stakeholders on the preferred candidate. \\nThe Committee was unanimous in its final selection \\nand recommended to the Board that Martin Scicluna \\nbe appointed as Chairman given his breadth of \\nexperience and his fit to the key attributes in the \\nagreed brief. It was also agreed that he be \\nappointed to the Nomination Committee. \\n\\nConsiderations\\nMartin Scicluna’s other roles were considered prior \\nto his appointment and the Board agreed that \\nthere was no conflict which might impact his role \\nat Sainsbury’s. The\\xa0Board also considered his other \\ncommitments from a time perspective, noting that \\nhe was Chairman at RSA Insurance Group plc, and \\nthat it had been announced that he would shortly \\nbe stepping down as Chairman of Great Portland \\nEstates plc. He stood down on 31 January 2019. \\nThe\\xa0Board considered that he would have sufficient \\ntime to fulfil his responsibilities to both the Company \\nand RSA Insurance Group plc on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nAppoint\\nMartin Scicluna’s appointment as a Non-Executive \\nDirector and Chairman-Designate took effect \\non\\xa01 November 2018, with him being appointed \\nas\\xa0Chairman when David Tyler stepped down \\non\\xa09 March 2019.\\n\\nDiversity and inclusion\\nThe Group’s aspiration is to be the most inclusive retailer, and the Board is \\nhighly supportive of the initiatives in place to promote diversity and inclusion \\nthroughout the business. Clear leadership of our inclusion agenda is set by \\nMike Coupe and the Operating Board, with senior management being set \\nannual objectives to drive progress through the business. The Group Diversity \\nand Inclusion Steering Group is chaired by the Group HR Director and is also \\nattended by three other Operating Board Directors who champion each \\ninclusion stream (gender, ethnicity, LGBT and disability/carers) with other \\nsenior leads from the different business units.\\n\\nThe Board receives regular inclusion updates and both the CR&S Committee \\nand the Nomination Committee receive detailed presentations on our \\ninclusion priorities and the progress we are making throughout the year. \\nMore about these initiatives and the progress being made can be found \\non\\xa0pages 26 and 27.\\n\\nThe Board believes there is a good balance of diversity amongst our \\nNon-Executive Directors, with several having extensive experience of retail \\nand consumer-facing businesses and other highly relevant skills derived \\nfrom serving in a range of major executive and non-executive positions \\nthroughout their careers. The Board feels that diversity is one of its strengths \\nand we will continue to appoint on merit whilst working hard to broaden the \\ndiversity of the talent pool. \\n\\nCurrently, female representation on the Board equates to 30 per cent.

This is my fourth letter to you as Audit \\n\\nCommittee Chair, and it sets out how the \\nCommittee has addressed both routine and \\n\\nemerging topics during the year.\\n\\nPrincipal role and responsibilities\\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight \\nresponsibilities by reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the \\nfinancial information provided to shareholders, the Company’s \\nsystems of internal control and risk management, the internal and \\nexternal audit process, the auditors, and the process for compliance \\nwith relevant laws and regulations. \\n\\nThe Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the Company’s \\nwebsite www.about.sainsburys.co.uk\\n\\nThe Committee operates a wide-ranging agenda which this year has \\nincluded cyber security, data governance, the potential impact of Brexit \\nand\\xa0financial reporting standard changes.\\n\\nCyber security and data governance remain high risk areas and are \\nimportant for every business which uses significant amounts of data for \\noperational efficiency and product delivery. The Committee received regular \\nreports and presentations on these topics during the year. These were \\nsupplemented by sessions with senior IT security and data managers to \\nobtain greater insight into Company processes and procedures.\\n\\nThe direction and impact of Brexit remains uncertain. The Company has \\nprepared for various scenarios, identifying where key risks lie and where \\nappropriate mitigations are in place to reduce the impact on supply chains, \\ncustomers and colleagues. The Committee will continue paying particular \\nattention to potential Brexit impacts as the situation develops.\\n\\nThe Committee has continued to monitor the Company’s financial \\nperformance and stress tested its ability to withstand potential shocks, \\nsuch\\xa0as from Brexit and other short-term risks. We have discussed \\nmedium-\\xa0and long-term finance structures at meetings with Finance and \\nTreasury managers (please refer to page 37 for our Statement of Viability). \\nThe Committee considers all accounting changes and approved the \\nimplementation of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from \\nCustomer Contracts’, and reviewed the approach to implementation \\nof\\xa0the\\xa0new IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.\\n\\nSpecific activities apart, the Committee continued its ‘business as usual’ \\nduties, which included the monitoring and review of internal and external \\nauditor programmes, principal risks and the integrity of the Group’s financial \\nstatements. As Chair, I also meet independently with the internal and \\nexternal auditors, the Chief Financial Officer, and Tax, Treasury and Finance \\nmanagers. I have an open and professional relationship with all of them and \\nretain a high degree of confidence in their capability and integrity. \\n\\nCommittee members have individually or collectively visited various Group \\nlocations during the year including stores, distribution centres and the \\noffices of Sainsbury’s, Sainsbury’s Argos and Sainsbury’s Bank. These site \\nvisits give us invaluable understanding and insights into the Group’s \\noperations and risk management.\\n\\nThe Committee’s effectiveness was considered as part of the Board \\nevaluation process (please refer to pages 54 and 55).

The independence and objectivity of the external audit function is a \\nfundamental safeguard to the interests of the Company’s shareholders. \\nDuring the year, the EY partner responsible for our last three annual audits \\nretired, and an alternative EY partner, who had not previously been involved \\nin the Company’s audit, was appointed. \\nThe Committee has overseen the Company’s policy which restricts the \\nengagement of EY in relation to non-audit services. The intention is to ensure \\nthat the provision of such services does not impact on the external auditor’s \\nindependence and objectivity. It\\xa0identifies certain types of engagement \\nthat the external auditor shall not undertake, including internal audit and \\nactuarial services relating to the preparation of accounting estimates for \\nthe financial statements. It requires that individual engagements above \\na certain fee level may only be undertaken with pre-approval from the \\nCommittee or, if urgent, from the Chair of the Committee and ratified by the \\nsubsequent meeting of the Committee. It recognises that there are some \\ntypes of work where a detailed understanding of the Company’s business \\nis advantageous. The policy is designed to ensure that the auditor is only \\nappointed to provide a\\xa0non-audit service where it is considered to be the \\nmost suitable supplier of\\xa0that service.\\nThe Committee received a report on the non-audit services being provided. \\nThe annual aggregate of non-audit fees is\\xa0capped at 70 per cent of the annual \\naverage of the audit fees for the Group for the preceding three-year period. \\nFollowing an effectiveness review, the Committee concluded that EY \\nremained objective and independent in their role as external auditors \\nand that they continue to challenge management effectively. \\nThe Committee has confirmed compliance with the provisions of the \\nStatutory Audit Services Order 2014.\\n\\nQuality and effectiveness of, our auditors, EY. The Committee reviewed EY’s effectiveness during the year, focusing on the \\naudit partner and audit team, their approach to the audit, communications \\nwith the Committee, how EY supported the work of the Committee, and their \\nindependence and objectivity. The Committee review was supported by \\nfeedback from management which was compiled from questionnaires \\ncompleted by Directors and managers in the business who were directly \\ninvolved with the audit. The questionnaire covered the audit team, audit \\nplanning and audit communication and execution. \\nThe Committee concluded that EY provided audit services efficiently and \\neffectively and to a high quality.\\n\\nRecommendation of the reappointment of EY as auditor.

Where \\napplicable, each grocery retailer had to appoint a Code Compliance Officer \\n(CCO) whose duties include hearing disputes between suppliers and the \\nrelevant retailer. Sainsbury’s has appointed the Director of Internal Audit \\nas its CCO. GSCOP requires that each applicable grocery retailer delivers an \\nannual compliance report to the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), which \\nhas been approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee. A summary of the \\ncompliance report must be included in the Annual Report and Financial \\nStatements, which is set out below.\\nSummary Annual Compliance Report\\nSainsbury’s compliance with the Code is based on clear policies and \\nprocedures, mandatory training and regular monitoring of compliance. \\nSainsbury’s has dedicated internal resources to provide all relevant colleagues \\nwith day-to-day advice and guidance. The Trading Division’s compliance \\nteam, in consultation with Group Legal and the CCO, continues to\\xa0assess the \\nadequacy of policies and procedures in place to support GSCOP awareness \\nand compliance. Collaboration between the Trading Division’s compliance \\nteam, Group Legal, Internal Audit and the CCO has been enhanced this year, \\nhelping to ensure that potential Code-related matters are identified promptly. \\nCompliance results, including performance against KPIs, are reported to \\nthe\\xa0Food Commercial Leadership Team quarterly. Additional assurance is \\nprovided by Internal Audit. \\nA small number of potential breaches of GSCOP were received in the year. \\nAs at 9 March 2019, all but one of these had been resolved either within our \\nTrading Division using standard escalation procedures or, in five of these \\ncases, through discussions between the CCO and the supplier. Actions are \\nin place to resolve the one case that is outstanding. None of these were \\npursued as formal Disputes with the CCO and none required referral to the \\nGCA for Arbitration. Group Legal, the compliance team and the CCO review \\nthe root causes of the potential breaches to identify any areas for \\nimprovement and to agree actions with the business. \\nThe CCO and the Committee Chair meet with the GCA on a regular basis. \\nSainsbury’s continues to work collaboratively and positively with the GCA \\nto proactively identify and address any areas for improvement in terms of \\nGSCOP compliance. Over the year, one of these meetings was attended by \\nthe Food Commercial Director and other senior stakeholders from supply \\nchain and trading to facilitate collaboration. Areas of focus this year included \\nworking to align our processes with the GCA’s forecasting best practice \\nstatement, refreshing our customer complaints process and reporting \\nperformance against a broader set of KPIs in relation to payments. \\nSainsbury’s is currently reviewing the outcomes from the GCA’s investigation \\ninto the Co-op to ascertain if any changes are required to achieve alignment.\\n\\nOngoing material litigation.

The processes \\nused during the year to support this assessment are as follows:\\n\\n — discussion and approval by the Board of the Company’s strategy, plans \\nand objectives, and the risks to achieving them;\\n\\n — review and approval by the Board of budgets and forecasts, for both \\nrevenue and capital expenditure;\\n\\n — reviews by management of the risks to achieving objectives and \\nmitigating controls and actions;\\n\\n — reviews by management and the Committee of the scope and results of \\nthe work of Internal Audit across the Company and of the implementation \\nof their recommendations;\\n\\n — reviews by the Committee of the scope and results of the work of the \\nexternal auditor and of any significant issues arising; \\n\\n — reviews by the Committee of accounting policies and levels of delegated \\nauthority; and\\n\\n — reviews by the Board and the Committee of material fraudulent activity \\nand any significant whistleblowing by colleagues, suppliers or other \\nparties and actions being taken to remedy any control weaknesses.\\n\\nRisk management and internal controls\\nThe Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal \\ncontrols, and for reviewing their effectiveness. Certain responsibilities \\nhave been delegated to the Audit Committee as outlined below. The risk \\nmanagement process is designed to manage rather than eliminate the \\nrisk of failure to achieve the Company’s business objectives and can only \\nprovide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material \\nmisstatement or\\xa0loss. \\n\\nThe risk management process and internal controls have been in place for \\nthe whole year, up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial \\nStatements and accord with the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance \\non Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business \\nReporting and the 2016 Code. \\n\\nThe Board received updates on risk management and internal controls \\nfrom the Chair of the Audit Committee (see page 61 for further details). \\nAll Committee papers and minutes were made available to the whole Board. \\n\\nThe Board also received reports on matters relating to safety, other \\nrelevant risks, controls and governance. Any significant matters which \\ncould have affected the Company’s reputation were reported to the \\nBoard as they occurred.\\n\\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the internal controls \\nand has ensured that any required remedial action, on any identified \\nweaknesses has been, or is being, taken. The following diagram provides \\nan overview of the key risk management activities undertaken by the \\nManagement Boards, Operating Board and Audit Committee that allow \\nthe Board to fulfil their obligations under the 2016 Code. \\n\\nThe annual risk management process concludes with the Board’s robust \\nassessment of the Company’s Principal risks and uncertainties disclosure, \\nincluding those that would threaten its business model, future performance, \\nsolvency or liquidity, and the completion of an annual internal controls \\ncertification.

The risk map captures the most significant risks faced by \\nthe\\xa0business and identifies the potential impact and likelihood at both \\na\\xa0gross level (before consideration of mitigating controls) and net level \\n(after\\xa0consideration of mitigating controls). The Operating Board discusses \\nand agrees the level of risk that the business is prepared to accept for each \\nkey corporate risk. The target risk position is captured to reflect management’s \\nrisk appetite where this differs to the current net position. The Operating \\nBoard also reviews the risk map twice a year. This enables the Operating \\nBoard to agree and monitor appropriate actions as required.\\n\\nThe risk management process is embedded at the Operating Board level \\nand is supported by bottom-up risk processes and discussions within \\noperating companies, Group functions and governance forums. Operating \\nBoard members certify annually that they are responsible for managing \\ntheir business objectives and internal controls to provide reasonable, but \\nnot absolute, assurance that the risks in their areas of responsibility are \\nappropriately identified, evaluated and managed. \\n\\nInternal Audit provides the Audit Committee with a risk management \\nupdate twice a year which includes the key risk activities undertaken at \\nManagement Board, Group Functions, Governance Forums, Divisional and \\nCorporate levels. \\n\\n66 Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nThe risk management process is illustrated in the following diagram. \\nThe specific risk management activities undertaken in the financial year \\nto 9 March 2019 were as follows:\\n\\n — Internal Audit facilitated risk workshops with the Management Boards, \\nGroup Functions, Governance Forums and each divisional leadership \\nteam to identify the key risks which may prevent the achievement of \\nBoard objectives. Each has produced and maintained a divisional risk \\nmap. The likelihood and impact of each key risk was evaluated at a \\ngross level (before consideration of mitigating controls) and net level \\n(after consideration of mitigating controls). Management’s risk appetite \\nwas reviewed and further actions to mitigate the risk were identified \\nif required.\\n\\n — Management Boards, Group Functions, Governance Forums and \\nDivisional management teams regularly review key risks and the \\neffectiveness and robustness of the mitigating controls as part of their \\nnormal business activities. Independent assurance over the controls is \\nalso provided through the delivery of the Internal Audit risk-based plan.\\n\\n — the Operating Board reviewed and challenged the output of the \\nbottom-up risk processes including new risks, risk movements and \\nkey\\xa0risk themes.

The Remuneration \\nCommittee remains committed to pay for \\n\\nperformance and reviews executive pay in the \\ncontext of Company results as well as having \\n\\nregard to pay throughout the business.\\n\\nOver the last year the Company delivered an underlying profit before tax \\nof\\xa0£635 million, which represents growth of 7.8 per cent. By focusing on our \\nstrategy and increasing efficiencies, we exceeded our cost savings target \\nand delivered synergies arising from the acquisition of Argos ahead of \\nschedule. We also lowered net debt, improved our cash position and \\nincreased our dividend by 7.8 per cent.\\n\\nIn the context of a highly competitive market, the Remuneration Committee \\nis pleased with the Company’s results and believes the business is well \\nplaced\\xa0to maximise opportunities for growth and to create value for all \\nour\\xa0stakeholders.\\n\\nAs part of the Remuneration Committee’s remit of having oversight of pay \\narrangements across the Group, we were kept updated on the significant \\nchanges to remuneration for Sainsbury’s store colleagues. As part of our \\n‘Winning Teams’ initiative, the business made an investment of over \\n£100\\xa0million in pay for Sainsbury’s store colleagues which took effect from \\nSeptember 2018. As well as introducing a single fair and consistent contract, \\ngiving us greater flexibility to ensure store colleagues are always in the right \\nplace at the right time for our customers, we made an industry-leading \\ninvestment in\\xa0pay, taking the base rate to £9.20 per hour, bringing the total \\nincrease to 30 per cent over the last four years.\\n\\nIn recognition of the great service Argos colleagues give to customers, \\nwe\\xa0have also invested in the pay rates of our Argos store colleagues. The \\nmajority of colleagues received an increase from £8.00 to £8.50 in April 2019, \\nbringing the increase to 18 per cent since we acquired Argos in September 2016. \\n\\nIn addition, during the year the Committee reviewed the Group’s Gender Pay \\nReport on behalf of the Board. We pay colleagues according to their role, not \\ntheir gender, and the Board is committed to improving the representation of \\nwomen at senior levels. In 2018, our mean gender pay gap reduced by 2.5 per \\ncent to 12.1 per cent and our median gender pay gap reduced by 0.6 per cent \\nto 3.8 per cent.\\n\\nIt is important that the pay for all our colleagues across the Group remains \\nconsistent with the principles of simplicity and fairness. For a number of \\nyears, Sainsbury’s has emphasised how our values make us different and \\nwe\\xa0seek to adopt a responsible approach to pay, that reflects our values, \\nboth across the Group and at more senior levels. \\n\\nFrom an Executive Director perspective, no major changes to pay have been \\nproposed for the coming year. \\n\\nOur remuneration policy, which governs executive pay at Sainsbury’s, was \\napproved by 96 per cent of our shareholders at the 2017 AGM and the \\nCommittee considers that it continues to work well. Under the normal \\nthree-year renewal cycle, the policy will next be presented to shareholders \\nfor approval at the 2020 AGM. In the coming year we will be reviewing our \\napproach to ensure that the policy continues to support the needs of the \\nbusiness as well as evolving market and best practice. This review will take \\nplace over the latter half of 2019 and we will seek to engage with our major \\nshareholders regarding the conclusions of this review.\\n\\n70 Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nRemuneration in 2018/19\\nWe remain committed to ensuring that rewards received by our executives \\nreflect the underlying performance of the business. Total remuneration for \\nthe Chief Executive and Executive Directors has increased reflecting the \\nprogress made during the year. \\n\\n — Annual bonus – Our Executive Directors were assessed against Group \\nprofit and individual annual operational objectives. The profit outcome \\nwas in the middle of the range set at the start of the year. The Directors \\nalso performed well against their objectives linked to individual strategic \\nand customer and colleague metrics. In light of the overall results, the \\nCommittee determined an annual bonus of circa 56 per cent \\nof\\xa0maximum should be paid to the Executive Directors in respect of \\nthe\\xa0year. \\n\\n — Deferred Share Award – The Committee determined that awards \\nunder\\xa0the DSA should be granted at 55 per cent of the maximum. This \\nrecognises the performance of the business against our internal targets, \\nmarket expectations and our competitors in a highly competitive retail \\nmarket and the achievements made on our strategic priorities. This \\naward is deferred into shares. In response to shareholder feedback, we \\nhave enhanced the disclosure this year so that shareholders can better \\nunderstand how outcomes have been determined. Details of financial \\nand non-financial targets and achievements are set out on pages \\n78\\xa0and\\xa079.\\n\\n — 2016 Future Builder – Reflecting our achievement against the five \\nperformance metrics, a performance multiplier of 2.2x (out of a \\nmaximum of 4.0) was applied to the core award for all participants \\nresulting in vesting of 55 per cent of the maximum. For this award, \\none-fifth of the award was linked to the delivery of synergies relating \\nto\\xa0the acquisition of Argos, and we were pleased to deliver these ahead \\nof\\xa0schedule. \\n\\nIn line with the new Corporate Governance Code (the 2018 Code), the \\nCommittee reviewed the outcomes of the individual incentive plans as well \\nas the overall levels of remuneration to ensure that they remained consistent \\nwith the underlying performance of the business. The Committee is satisfied \\nthat the total remuneration received by Executive Directors in respect of \\n2018/19 is a fair reflection of performance over the period.\\n\\nRemuneration in 2019/20\\nAs noted above, no major changes to remuneration are being proposed for \\nthe coming year. Key decisions in relation to remuneration for 2019/20 are \\nset\\xa0out below.\\n\\n — Salary – We have awarded Mike Coupe, Kevin O’Byrne and John Rogers \\na\\xa0salary increase of two per cent effective March 2019, which aligns with \\nthat awarded to other management colleagues. As noted above, other \\ncolleague populations received larger increases.\\n\\n — 2019/20 annual bonus – We will continue to operate the annual bonus for \\n2018/19 to reflect the approach we take for our management colleagues. \\n70 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity will be based on Group \\nprofit and 30 per cent on business specific annual operational objectives.\\n\\n — 2019/20 Deferred Share Award – Executive Directors will participate in the \\nDSA for 2019/20 on the same basis as 2018/19. They will be rewarded for \\nthe delivery of performance against a diverse range of key financial and \\nstrategic scorecard measures. \\n\\n — 2019 Future Builder – Our approach to the 2019 Future Builder awards \\nwill\\xa0be broadly unchanged from 2018. Awards will be based on four \\nequally weighted performance measures: return on capital employed, \\nearnings per share, free cash flow and cost savings. We reviewed the \\ntargets to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and increased \\nthe\\xa0free cash flow and cost savings targets to reflect our corporate plan. \\nFollowing the three-year performance period, awards are subject to a \\nfurther two-year holding period. Further details of the awards are set out \\non pages 80 and 81.\\n\\nDuring the year the Committee has also considered how we will comply \\nwith\\xa0the new 2018 Code that will apply to Sainsbury’s for the 2019/20 \\nfinancial year. As outlined above, the Remuneration Committee already \\nspends significant time providing oversight of pay arrangements in the \\nwider business and we have now formalised this practice in the Committee’s \\nTerms of Reference. We have also taken steps to strengthen some of our \\ninternal processes to ensure we can exercise suitable discretion in our \\nincentive plans in line with the new 2018 Code. While we are well placed to \\ncomply with the majority of the 2018 Code, clearly there are certain aspects, \\nsuch as our approach to pensions for any new Board appointments and our \\npolicy for post-employment shareholding, which will require further \\nconsideration.

As a Group \\nwith\\xa0multiple business units, the principles of fairness, equality and simplicity are important to us, and we aim for consistency in pay and benefits where \\nappropriate. This overall reward strategy is the foundation for the remuneration policy for senior executives.\\n\\nThe over-arching objectives of the remuneration policy are to ensure rewards are fair, performance-based and encourage long-term shareholder value \\ncreation. The remuneration policy for our senior executives is based on the following principles: \\n\\nLinked to our \\nbusiness strategy\\n\\nEncourages the \\nright behaviours \\n\\nto deliver  \\nlong-term growth\\n\\nAligned to  \\nour values\\n\\nSecures high \\ncalibre leaders\\n\\nEnables share \\nownership\\n\\nThe Committee takes a rounded approach to pay and considers a variety of factors when determining, and subsequently implementing, the policy for senior \\nmanagement. The Committee believes it is important to exercise sound judgement at all stages during the process to ensure that executive pay levels \\nappropriately reflect performance and are aligned with the interests of shareholders. \\n\\nWhen reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee considers our business goals, pay practices across the Company and the retail sector more \\ngenerally, the impact on colleagues, the cost to the Company, stakeholder views (including shareholders, governance bodies and colleagues) and best practice.\\n\\nSingle total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors (audited information)\\nThe table below shows a single remuneration figure for all qualifying services for the 52 weeks to 9 March 2019, together with comparative figures for the \\n52\\xa0weeks to 10 March 2018.\\n\\nMike Coupe \\n£000\\n\\nKevin O’Byrne5 \\n£000\\n\\nJohn Rogers \\n£000\\n\\nNotes 2018/19 2017/18 2018/19 2017/18 2018/19 2017/18\\n\\nBase salary 962 943 638 625 709 695\\n\\nBenefits 1 17 17 17 17 85 90\\n\\nPension 289 283 159 156 177 174\\n\\nTotal fixed pay 1,268 1,243 814 798 971 959\\n\\nAnnual bonus 2 593 427 316 238 357 264\\n\\nDeferred Share Award 3 582 758 316 411 351 457\\n\\nLTIP/Future Builder 4 1,438 1,202 787 – 848 641\\n\\nTotal 3,881 3,630 2,233 1,447 2,527 2,321\\n\\n1  Benefits include a combination of cash and non-cash benefits, valued at the taxable value.

Where relevant, the Committee also considers external market data on salary and total remuneration but the Committee applies \\njudgement when considering such data. The salary review for management and central colleagues in March 2019 was generally two per cent. As outlined in \\nthe Remuneration Committee Chair’s letter, we have invested heavily in both our Sainsbury’s store and Argos store colleagues, resulting in higher increases in \\nthe standard base rates for colleagues compared to increases for management colleagues.\\n\\nFor 2019/20 Mike Coupe, Kevin O’Byrne and John Rogers will receive a salary increase of two per cent effective March 2019, in line with other management \\ncolleagues. \\n\\nPension \\nIn lieu of pension plan participation, Mike Coupe receives a cash pension supplement of 30 per cent of salary and Kevin O’Byrne and John Rogers receive \\n25\\xa0per cent of salary. No Director has any entitlement to a Sainsbury’s defined benefit pension. All pension arrangements were implemented prior to the \\npublication of the 2018 Code.\\n\\nAs communicated in last year’s Remuneration Report, under the forward-looking policy, retirement benefits for any future appointments are capped at \\n25\\xa0per cent of salary, rather than the previous limit of 30 per cent. We will review this again, in light of the updated 2018 Code, as part of the 2020 Directors’ \\nRemuneration Policy review.\\n\\nBenefits \\nFor 2018/19 and 2019/20, benefits for Executive Directors include the provision of company car benefits, private medical cover, long-term disability insurance, \\nlife assurance and colleague discount. Benefits for John Rogers also include an annual travel allowance and accommodation costs, in relation to a change of \\nlocation to Milton Keynes, following appointment as CEO of Sainsbury’s Argos.\\n\\nPerformance-related pay\\nThe Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the Executive Directors’ package is performance-related and that the performance \\nconditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Company’s strategy and the long-term sustainable success of the Company. \\n\\nThe specific metrics incorporated into the annual bonus, Deferred Share Award and Future Builder are built around the overall strategy and our key priorities.\\n\\n1 Differentiate food and grocery through quality, value and service\\n\\nPr\\nof\\n\\nit\\n\\nA\\nnn\\n\\nua\\nl o\\n\\npe\\nra\\n\\nti\\non\\n\\nal\\n o\\n\\nbj\\nec\\n\\nti\\nve\\n\\ns\\n\\nFi\\nna\\n\\nnc\\nia\\n\\nl p\\ner\\n\\nfo\\nrm\\n\\nan\\nce\\n\\nRe\\ntu\\n\\nrn\\ns \\n\\nto\\n s\\n\\nha\\nre\\n\\nho\\nld\\n\\ner\\ns\\n\\nRe\\nla\\n\\nti\\nve\\n\\n p\\ner\\n\\nfo\\nrm\\n\\nan\\nce\\n\\nSt\\nra\\n\\nte\\ngi\\n\\nc \\npr\\n\\nio\\nri\\n\\nti\\nes\\n\\nRO\\nCE\\n\\nEP\\nS\\n\\nFr\\nee\\n\\n c\\nas\\n\\nh \\nfl\\n\\now\\n\\n2 Grow General Merchandise and\\xa0Clothing\\n3 Offer our customers easy access to\\xa0financial services\\n4 Generate efficiencies to invest in\\xa0our\\xa0digital future\\n\\nCo\\nst\\n\\n s\\nav\\n\\nin\\ngs\\n\\n5 Strengthen the balance sheet \\n\\nColleagues \\nmaking the \\ndifference\\n\\nThere  \\nfor our  \\n\\ncustomers\\n\\nGreat \\nproducts and \\n\\nservices at \\nfair prices\\n\\nOur values  \\nmake us  \\ndifferent\\n\\nAnnual bonus\\nShort-term\\n\\nDeferred Share Award\\nMedium-term\\n\\nFuture Builder\\nLong-term\\n\\nW\\ne \\n\\nkn\\now\\n\\n ou\\nr cu\\n\\nstom\\ners better than anyone else\\n\\n 75Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance R\\n\\neport\\nStrategic Report\\n\\nFinancial Statem\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Board is of the opinion that the performance targets for the 2019/20 \\nannual bonus and Deferred Share Award are commercially sensitive as the \\nCompany operates in a highly competitive, consumer-facing sector. The \\ndisclosure of targets would provide competitors with insights into the \\nCompany’s strategic aims, budgeting and growth projections. However, in \\nline with previous years, the Company is retrospectively disclosing the \\nfinancial performance targets set for the 2018/19 annual bonus in order to \\nprovide greater transparency. Detailed disclosure is also provided in relation \\nto the Deferred Share Award so that shareholders can understand the basis \\nfor payments. Targets for Future Builder awards have been disclosed on a \\nprospective basis.\\n\\nAnnual bonus\\n2019/20 policy\\nWe will follow the same, simplified approach as used for the 2018/19 annual \\nbonus. The Board and senior management bonus will be based 70 per cent \\non Group profit and 30 per cent on annual operational objectives. We believe \\nthat Group profit is the most important measure for senior managers as it is \\nthe ultimate outcome of engaging our colleagues, providing great customer \\nservice, driving sales and managing costs. \\n\\nThe Group profit targets are set against the Company’s expected \\nperformance and are subject to a rigorous process of challenge before  \\nthe proposals are considered by the Board. The targets are set such that \\nconsiderably stretching performance in excess of internal and external \\nforecasts is required for maximum payout. \\n\\nAnnual operational objectives ensure that management continue to focus  \\non operational priorities which contribute to the achievement of Group \\nprofitability over the short and long term. For Executive Directors, these \\nobjectives will be grouped around two equally weighted elements of \\nindividual strategic and customer and colleague. The individual strategic \\nobjectives will be based around our strategic priorities and will be specific to \\neach Director (for example, John Roger’s objectives will include Sainsbury’s \\nArgos performance). The customer and colleague element will include \\ncustomer service, and colleague metrics based on engagement scores and \\ninclusion. \\n\\nThe maximum annual bonus award opportunity for the Chief Executive is \\n110\\xa0per cent of base salary and for the other Executive Directors is 90 per cent \\nof base salary. Historically the annual bonus has operated with a \\nperformance gateway whereby a minimum level of profit must be met \\nbefore any payments under the annual bonus are made to Executive \\nDirectors. Taking into account the updated 2018 Code, from 2019/20 the \\nperformance gateway has been strengthened so that the Committee may \\nadjust outcomes if it considers that they do not reflect the underlying \\nfinancial or non-financial performance of the Executives or the Group. The \\nannual bonus is paid in cash after the year-end.\\n\\n2018/19 annual bonus outturn (audited information)\\nThe performance measures for 2018/19 were Group profit and annual \\noperational objectives. As the gateway level of profit was achieved, Executive \\nDirectors are eligible to be considered for a payment under the annual bonus \\nfor 2018/19.\\n\\nFinancial performance \\nThe table below sets out the threshold and stretch profit and sales targets \\nand the actual outturn for 2018/19.\\n\\nThreshold Stretch Actual\\n\\nProfit1 £585m £685m £635m\\n\\n1 Underlying profit before tax.\\n\\nThe profit targets were robustly set at the start of the year reflecting both \\nour internal and external forecasts at that time. \\n\\nOur senior team, managers and colleagues throughout our business all \\nshared a consistent focus to drive sales, control costs and deliver great \\nproducts and services to our customers. This enabled us to deliver profit in \\nline with expectations resulting in an outturn in the middle of the \\nperformance range.\\n\\nAnnual operational performance \\nThe remainder of the bonus was focused on annual operational objectives \\nsplit into two equally weighted elements, (i) individual strategic and (ii) \\ncustomer and colleague. \\nThe tables opposite set out the objectives and the Executive Directors’ \\nperformance in relation to these objectives as assessed by the Remuneration \\nCommittee. The Executive Directors have specific individual strategic \\nobjectives but common customer and colleague objectives, although there  \\nis a greater emphasis on Sainsbury’s Argos for John Rogers.\\n\\n2018/19 annual bonus payments\\nOverall, the Committee is comfortable with the bonus outcomes, particularly \\nwhen the broader context of the retail market performance is considered. \\nThe table below shows the bonus payable as included in the single total \\nfigure table as well as a breakdown by element.\\n\\nMaximum \\nopportunity Outcome\\n\\nPer cent of \\nsalary\\n\\nPer cent of \\nsalary\\n\\nValue \\n£000\\n\\nMike Coupe\\n\\nProfit 77% 39% £371\\n\\nAnnual operational objectives 33% 23% £222\\n\\nTotal 110% 62% £593\\n\\nKevin O’Byrne\\n\\nProfit 63% 32% £201\\n\\nAnnual operational objectives 27% 18% £115\\n\\nTotal 90% 50% £316\\n\\nJohn Rogers\\n\\nProfit 63% 32% £224\\n\\nAnnual operational objectives 27% 19% £133\\n\\nTotal 90% 50% £357\\n\\n76 Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnual operational performance \\nIndividual strategic objectives\\nMike Coupe\\n\\nObjectives Achievements\\n\\nDriving strategy\\n — Complete the delivery of the Argos acquisition plan;

The categories and measures \\nfor\\xa02019/20 are broadly similar to those disclosed for 2018/19.\\n\\nAs outlined in our remuneration policy, at least 50 per cent of the award \\nwill\\xa0be based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to \\nshareholders. In addition, in line with the annual bonus, from 2019/20 the \\nperformance gateway has been strengthened so that the Committee may \\nadjust outcomes if it considers that they do not reflect the underlying \\nfinancial or non-financial performance of the Executives or the Group.\\n\\nPerformance is assessed over one financial year, but any shares awarded are \\ndeferred for a further two financial years. The shares are subject to forfeiture \\nif the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to their release date. \\nDividends accrue on any shares that subsequently vest.\\n\\nThe maximum DSA award opportunity for the Chief Executive is 110 per cent \\nof base salary and for the other Executive Directors is 90 per cent of base salary.\\n\\n2018/19 Deferred Share Award (audited information) \\nFollowing the year-end, the Committee conducted a rigorous assessment \\nof\\xa0performance. Consistent with the underlying principles of the DSA, the \\nCommittee assessed achievements in the round and also considered the \\nmanner in which these performance goals had been delivered and how this \\ncontributes to the Company’s future sustainable growth and success. \\n\\nThe Committee reviews performance against expectations using the \\nfollowing assessment grid:\\n\\nRating Performance\\n\\nOutperformance Delivers strong performance beyond \\nexpectations, raising the bar on  \\nexpected results\\nClear evidence of raising strategic  \\nambition/progression\\n\\nGood Demonstrates a good performance against \\nall\\xa0objectives and performance areas\\nIs consistent with progression against the \\nCompany’s strategic targets\\n\\nOn track Delivers a solid rounded performance  \\nagainst most objectives and all critical \\nperformance areas\\n\\nPartially met Delivers against some objectives and  \\nmost critical performance areas\\n\\nUnderperformance Performance is low with important  \\nobjectives and targets not achieved\\n\\nDuring the year the Company met or exceeded the majority of its financial \\ntargets. The full-year dividend payment grew by 7.8 per cent and, while \\nin-year relative performance was below expectations, this follows robust \\nperformance in prior years and is due to the highly competitive market  \\nand recovery in peer results. The Company also made progress against its \\nstrategic priorities, particularly driving efficiencies, which provides a solid \\nfoundation to maximise opportunities for growth and to create value for  \\nall stakeholders.\\n\\nThe Committee, therefore, agreed that for 2018/19 awards would be made \\nat\\xa055 per cent of the maximum level, compared with 73 per cent last year. \\nIt\\xa0also determined that the performance gateway for the plan was  \\nachieved. Although some of the specific measures and targets are \\ncommercially sensitive, the table on the following page presents a selection \\nof performance highlights which the Committee took into account within \\neach of the four categories.\\n\\nThe table below sets out details of the awards and these are the figures set \\nout in the DSA row of the single total figure table.

Around 275 senior managers across the business participate in this \\narrangement. Awards are granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan \\napproved by shareholders in 2016.\\n\\nFuture Builder awards have been granted under the same structure for a \\nnumber of years. A core award of shares is granted, calculated as a percentage \\nof salary and scaled according to level of seniority. Vesting of the core award \\nis dependent on performance against specific targets tested at the end of a \\nthree-year performance period. The core awards can grow up to four times \\nat stretch levels of performance. \\n\\nFor Executive Directors, historically, awards have been structured so that half \\nof any awards vest following the end of the performance period, with the \\nremaining half vesting after a further year. For awards granted to Executive \\nDirectors from 2017 onwards, awards will normally be subject to a two-year \\nholding period following the end of the three-year performance period. \\nThis\\xa0will result in awards to Executive Directors being released after a \\nfive-year period. \\n\\nThe Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the Company’s \\nunderlying performance over the period justifies the level of vesting; vesting \\nwill be reduced if not. When making this judgement the Committee has \\nscope to consider such factors as it deems relevant. The Committee believes \\nthat this discretion is an important feature of the plan and mitigates the risk \\nof unwarranted vesting outcomes. This performance gateway assessment \\napplies to all outstanding Future Builder awards. \\n\\n2019 Future Builder awards (2022 vesting)\\nAward levels will remain unchanged for the coming year. In 2019 Mike Coupe \\nwill receive a core award of 62.5 per cent of salary (maximum 250 per cent of \\nsalary) and the other Executive Directors will receive core awards of 50 per \\ncent of salary (maximum 200 per cent of salary). \\n\\nThe 2019 awards will be subject to four metrics: ROCE, EPS, free cash flow \\nand cost savings. \\n\\nThe ROCE, EPS, free cash flow and cost savings targets have been reviewed, \\nand the Committee increased the free cash flow and cost savings targets to \\nreflect the corporate plan. The Committee is confident that the target ranges \\nare stretching and reflect the current and future prospects of the business as \\nwell as the retail sector as a whole over the next three years.\\n\\nThe agreed measures, targets and weightings for 2019 awards are as follows:\\n\\nMeasure Weighting\\n\\nThreshold \\ntarget\\n\\n(1.0x core \\naward)\\n\\nMaximum \\ntarget\\n\\n(4.0x core \\naward)\\n\\nROCE 25% 8.0% 11.0%\\n\\nUnderlying basic EPS 25% 23.0p 30.0p\\n\\nCumulative free cash flow 25% £900m £1,400m\\n\\nCumulative strategic cost savings 25% £600m £750m\\n\\n2019 Future Builder performance measures (definitions for \\nother awards can be found in the relevant Annual Report)\\nROCE\\n\\n — ROCE reflects the returns generated for shareholders and measures \\nthe efficiency of capital use. \\n\\n — It is based on the underlying profit before interest and tax for the \\nwhole business, with Sainsbury’s Bank fully consolidated, including \\nthe underlying share of post-tax profit from joint ventures. The capital \\nemployed figure excludes the impact of movements in the IAS 19 \\npension deficit.\\n\\nEPS\\n — EPS directly reflects returns generated for shareholders. \\n — Underlying basic EPS is based on underlying profit after tax divided \\nby the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during \\nthe year.\\n\\nFree cash flow \\n — Free cash flow measures the total flow of cash in and out  \\nof the business as well as providing an assessment of  \\nunderlying profitability.\\n\\n — Free cash flow for these purposes is retail operating cash flow  \\nafter changes in working capital, normal pension contributions, \\ninterest and corporate tax paid, normal net capex (for example,  \\nthis would exclude strategic purchases and sale and leaseback  \\nof assets) and capital injections into the Bank. It is cumulative  \\nover the performance period.\\n\\nCost savings\\n — Cost savings is one of our key strategic targets and the level of \\nsavings targeted will require structural changes. This is a key \\nlong-term measure which is fundamental to delivering returns  \\nto shareholders.\\n\\n — Cumulative strategic cost savings represents cost reductions over  \\nthe performance period as a result of identified initiatives.\\n\\n80 Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n2016 Future Builder (2016/17 to 2018/19 performance period) (audited information)\\nThe 2016 Future Builder award was subject to ROCE, EPS, cash flow, cost savings and Home Retail Group (HRG) synergy targets. The 2016 Future Builder award \\nwas the first award following the acquisition of HRG and, to reflect the importance of delivering synergies to the deal, the Committee introduced HRG synergy \\ntargets as a fifth measure. In addition, a performance gateway had to be achieved before any element could vest. \\n\\nThe Committee reviewed the formulaic outcome of the awards and determined that it was appropriate to make an adjustment to the calculation of \\nunderlying cash flow so that the costs associated with the structural changes made in stores were included as they were incurred as a result of management \\nactions. This reduced the cash flow outcome for the purposes of the award and therefore resulted in the multiplier reducing from 2.3x to 2.2x. This multiplier is \\napplied to the core award, i.e. 55 per cent of the maximum available award vested.

This is to create greater alignment of the \\nDirectors’ interests with those of shareholders, in line with the objectives \\nof the remuneration policy. The guidelines were updated in the 2017 \\nDirectors’ Remuneration Policy and require the Chief Executive to have \\na\\xa0holding of 2.5\\xa0times salary and other Executive Directors to hold \\nshares\\xa0with a value of 2.0 times salary. Directors are required to build \\nthis\\xa0shareholding within five years of appointment to the relevant role. \\nIn\\xa0addition to shares held, share awards under the DSA and Future \\nBuilder\\xa0awards where the\\xa0performance period has ended count \\ntowards\\xa0the guideline (on\\xa0a\\xa0net of tax basis).\\n\\nBoth Mike Coupe and John Rogers have shareholdings that meet and \\nexceed the shareholding guideline.

Participation in Sharesave is \\nconditional on three months’ service. Executive Directors may participate in \\nthese plans in the same way as all other colleagues. Mike Coupe participates \\nin Sharesave and John Rogers currently participates in SSPP. As\\xa0these are \\nall-employee plans there are no performance conditions.\\n\\nThe 2013 Sharesave plan (five-year), with a £3.32 option price, and the 2015 \\nSharesave plan (three-year), with a £1.95 option price, came to an end on \\n1\\xa0March 2019 for over 10,000 colleagues. Colleagues could either take their \\nsavings or use the money to buy Sainsbury’s shares at the option price. Using \\nthe market price on the date of the first exercise, the value of all the shares \\nsubject to the maturity was over £14.5 million. The Company currently has \\nover 29,500 colleagues participating in Sharesave with around 57,643 \\nindividual savings contracts.\\n\\nDilution \\nThe Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Company’s \\nshare plans and the means of satisfying such awards remain within best \\npractice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not \\nexceed ten per cent of the Company’s issued share capital for all-employee \\nshare plans and five per cent in respect of executive share plans in any \\nten-year rolling period. The Company monitors dilution levels on a regular \\nbasis and the Committee reviews these at least once a year.

The Committee considers their views when reviewing \\nthe remuneration of the Executive Directors and Operating Board Directors. \\nIndividuals who attend Remuneration Committee meetings are not present \\nwhen their own remuneration is being determined. \\n\\nThe Committee typically meets four times each year, or more as required. \\nThe Committee has a calendar of standard items within its remit and in \\naddition it held in-depth discussions on specific topics during the year. The \\nkey issues the Committee discussed during the year were remuneration \\narrangements in relation to changes on the Operating Board, enhancing the \\ndisclosure for the Deferred Share Award outturn to provide shareholders with \\nmore information on the performance assessment, and the proposed \\nchanges to the 2018 Code. \\n\\nThe Committee complies with relevant regulations and considers the UK \\nCorporate Governance Code and best practice when determining pay and \\npolicy. The Committee is well placed to comply with the new Code given its \\nhistoric practice of considering remuneration across the wider Group, to \\nensure that pay and incentives across the Company support the long-term \\nsuccess of the business. \\n\\nAdvisers to the Remuneration Committee\\nThe Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers if it \\nconsiders this beneficial. Over the course of the year, the Committee was \\nsupported by its appointed advisers, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). Deloitte were \\nreappointed by the Committee as advisers in 2013 following a competitive \\ntender. During the year they provided advice to the Committee on a range of \\ntopics including remuneration trends, corporate governance, incentive plan \\ndesign, incentive plan rules and the remuneration policy. Their consultants \\nattended all of the Committee meetings. In relation to their advice, Deloitte \\nreceived fees of circa £80,000 (fees are based on hours spent). During the \\nyear, Deloitte provided the Company with unrelated advice and consultancy \\non transaction support and due diligence, information technology, \\norganisational structure, data analytics and taxation.\\n\\nDeloitte are members of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, \\noperate under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration \\nconsulting in the UK. During the year, the Committee reviewed the advice \\nprovided by Deloitte and has confirmed that it has been objective and \\nindependent. The Committee has also determined that the Deloitte partner \\nwho provides remuneration advice to the Committee does not have any \\nconnections with the Company that may impact their independence. The \\nCommittee has reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged \\nthat there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. \\n\\nStatement of voting at general meeting\\nThe table below sets out the votes on the Annual Report on Remuneration \\nat\\xa0the 2018 AGM and on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2017 AGM. \\nThe Committee is keen to hear the views of all shareholders and continually \\nreviews the remuneration policy and its implementation.\\n\\nVotes for Votes against\\nVotes \\n\\nabstained\\n\\nRemuneration Report (2018 vote) 95.31%\\n1,586 million\\n\\n4.69% \\n78 million\\n\\n–\\n57 million\\n\\nRemuneration Policy (2017 vote) 95.60%\\n1,519 million\\n\\n4.40%\\n70 million\\n\\n–\\n57 million\\n\\n84 Governance J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nDetails of the Executive Directors’ share awards and movements during the year (audited information) \\nThe table below shows the conditional awards granted and exercised under each of the Company’s share plans. \\n\\nName Award\\nDate of \\n\\naward\\n\\nShare \\nprice at \\ndate of \\naward \\n\\n(pence)\\n\\nOption \\nprice\\n\\n(pence)\\n\\nNumber of \\noptions held at \\n\\n10 March 2018\\n\\nNumber \\nof options \\n\\ngranted/ \\ndividend \\n\\nshares \\nallocated \\n\\nduring the \\nyear\\n\\nNumber \\nof options \\nexercised \\n\\nduring the \\nyear\\n\\nNumber \\nof options \\n\\nlapsed \\nduring the \\n\\nyear\\n\\nShare price \\non exercise \\n\\n(pence)\\nDate of \\n\\nexercise\\n\\nNotional  \\ngain on \\n\\nexercise\\n(£000)4\\n\\nNumber of \\noptions held \\n\\nat 9 March \\n2019\\n\\nMike Coupe \\n\\nLong-Term \\nIncentive Plan1\\n\\n15/05/2014 333 Nil 67,471 12,522 79,993 – 301 04/05/2018 241 –\\n\\n14/05/2015 269 Nil 828,880 22,894 199,031 476,606 301 04/05/2018 599 176,137\\n\\n12/05/2016 253 Nil 876,936 – – – – – – 876,936\\n\\n11/05/2017 265 Nil 883,092 – – – – – – 883,092\\n\\n11/05/2018 307 Nil – 800,260 – – – – – 800,260\\n\\nDeferred Share \\nAward2\\n\\n12/05/2016 253 Nil 304,121 25,555 329,676 – 301 04/05/2018 993 –\\n\\n11/05/2017 265 Nil 267,973 – – – – – – 267,973\\n\\n11/05/2018 307 Nil – 252,003 – – – – – 252,003\\n\\nSharesave3 11/12/2013 388 332 4,518 – – – – – – 4,518\\n\\nTotal 3,232,991 1,113,234 608,700 476,606 – – 1,833 3,260,919\\n\\nKevin O’Byrne\\n\\nLong-Term \\nIncentive Plan1\\n\\n26/01/2017 258 Nil 479,660 – – – – – – 479,660\\n\\n11/05/2017 265 Nil 468,024 – – – – – – 468,024\\n\\n11/05/2018 307 Nil – 424,120 – – – – – 424,120\\n\\nDeferred Share \\nAward2 11/05/2018 307 Nil – 136,592 – – – – – 136,592\\n\\nTotal 947,684 560,712 – – – – – 1,508,396\\n\\nJohn Rogers\\n\\nLong-Term \\nIncentive Plan1\\n\\n15/05/2014 333 Nil 40,426 7,500 47,926 – 301 04/05/2018 144 –\\n\\n14/05/2015 269 Nil 442,068 12,208 106,146 254,190 301 04/05/2018 319 93,940\\n\\n12/05/2016 253 Nil 517,112 – – – – – – 517,112\\n\\n11/05/2017 265 Nil 520,744 – – – – – – 520,744\\n\\n11/05/2018 307 Nil – 471,896 – – – – – 471,896\\n\\nDeferred Share \\nAward2\\n\\n12/05/2016 253 Nil 183,410 15,410 198,820 – 301 04/05/2018 599 –\\n\\n11/05/2017 265 Nil 161,610 – – – – – – 161,610\\n\\n11/05/2018 307 Nil – 151,978 – – – – – 151,978\\n\\nTotal 1,865,370 658,992 352,892 254,190 – – 1,062 1,917,280\\n\\n1 Details of the performance conditions applying to Future Builder awards are set out on pages 80 and 81.

Under that law, the Directors have \\nprepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International \\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) \\nand have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in \\naccordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, \\nincluding FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (UK Accounting Standards \\nand applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the \\nfinancial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair \\nview of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit \\nor loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, \\nthe Directors are required to:\\n— select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\\n— make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable \\n\\nand prudent;\\n— state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable \\n\\nUK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material \\ndepartures disclosed and explained in the Group and Company financial \\nstatements respectively; and\\n\\n— prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless \\nit is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will \\ncontinue in business.\\n\\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records \\nthat are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s \\ntransactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial \\nposition of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the \\nfinancial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with \\nthe Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, \\nArticle 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding \\nthe assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable \\nsteps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\\n\\nHaving taken all the matters considered by the Board and brought to the \\nattention of the Board during the year into account, we are satisfied that the \\nAnnual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced \\nand understandable.\\n\\nThe Board believes that the disclosures set out in this Annual Report \\nprovide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s \\nperformance, business model and strategy.\\n\\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the \\nCompany’s website.

We performed audit procedures on \\nspecific balances of Argos Financial Services, Nectar, the property \\ncompanies, the information systems company, material joint \\nventures and the insurance company due to the size and risk \\nof certain individual balances within these components.\\n\\n— The components where we performed full or specific scope \\naudit procedures accounted for 98 per cent of Profit before tax \\nbefore one-off items, 99 per cent of Revenue and 100 per cent \\nof Total assets.\\n\\nMateriality\\n— Overall Group materiality is £30.5 million which represents \\n\\n5 per cent of profit before tax and before non-recurring Argos \\nintegration costs, Sainsbury’s Bank transition costs, one-off \\npension costs and other one-off related costs (mainly Asda \\nrelated costs and restructuring costs).

These \\nmatters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit \\nstrategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts \\nof the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of \\nour audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, \\nand we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\n\\nChanges from the prior year\\nIn the prior year, we included the Nectar acquisition as a key audit matter. \\nIn the current year, this risk is no longer assessed as a key audit matter on \\nthe basis that there were no significant adjustments in the finalisation of the \\npurchase price allocation of the Nectar entities.\\n\\nDue to the complexities involved in assessing the impact of transition to the \\nnew leasing standard (IFRS 16), we have included this as a key audit matter \\nin the current year.\\n\\nRisk \\nSupplier arrangements\\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 60); Accounting policies \\n(page 105); and note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 112)\\n\\nThe Group receives material discounts from suppliers, referred to as supplier \\narrangements. The accounting for some of these supplier arrangements is \\ncomplex since management applies judgement, processing is either manual \\nor more complex and the quantum of agreements is high. We focused our \\naudit procedures on these complex supplier arrangements.\\n\\nComplex supplier arrangements recognised in the income statement \\nfor the financial year are £457 million (2017/18: £450 million).\\n\\nOur response to the risk\\n— We walked through the controls in place within the supplier \\n\\narrangements process. We were able to take a controls-reliance \\napproach over certain aspects of the process, testing the key controls, \\nalthough there are areas where we cannot, as the process for recording \\ndeals is manual.\\n\\n— We selected a sample of suppliers to whom we sent confirmations \\nacross all “deal” types to confirm key deal input terms. Where we did \\nnot receive a response from the supplier, we performed alternative \\nprocedures, including obtaining evidence of initiation and if settled, \\nsettlement of the arrangement.\\n\\n— We tested the existence and valuation of balance sheet amounts \\nrecognised in accounts receivable and as a contra-asset in accounts \\npayable by reviewing post-period end settlement. We also performed \\na ‘look-back’ analysis of prior period balance sheet amounts to check \\nthat these amounts were appropriately recovered.\\n\\n— We tested the settlement of a sample of supplier arrangements \\nrecognised in the income statement, which included settlement \\nin cash or by off-set to accounts payable.\\n\\n— Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the \\nappropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments to supplier \\narrangements to corroborating evidence.\\n\\n— We tested deals recorded post period end and obtained the supplier \\nagreement to validate that the deal was correctly recorded post \\nperiod end.\\n\\n— We read management’s disclosure in respect of supplier arrangement \\namounts recorded in the income statement and balance sheet to \\nconfirm completeness and accuracy of amounts disclosed.\\n\\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\\nSupplier arrangement amounts are appropriately recognised in the income \\nstatement and balance sheet and the disclosure in the financial statements \\nis appropriate.\\n\\nRisk \\nAspects of revenue recognition\\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 60); Accounting policies \\n(page 108); and Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 108)\\n\\nOur assessment is that the vast majority of the Group’s revenue transactions \\nare non-complex, with no judgement applied over the amount recorded. \\nWe focused our work on the manual adjustments that are made to revenue \\nwhere the amount of the revenue recorded can be different than the amount \\nof cash received.\\n\\nOur procedures were designed to address the risk of manipulation \\nof accounting records and the ability to override controls.\\n\\nOur response to the risk\\n— We obtained a detailed understanding of these manual adjustments. \\n\\nDue to the manual nature of these adjustments, we performed \\nsubstantive audit procedures.\\n\\n— We used our computer-aided data analytics tools to identify \\nthose revenue journals for which the corresponding entry was not \\ncash. These entries include Nectar points, coupons, vouchers and \\ncommission arrangements. \\n\\n— We obtained corroborating evidence for such corresponding entries. \\nFor the Nectar points adjustment we obtained evidence that revenue \\nis deferred appropriately based on the number of points issued and \\nredeemed and the breakage assumption. For third party coupons and \\nvouchers we obtained evidence of collection and settlement.\\n\\n— Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the \\nappropriateness of journal entries impacting revenue, as well as other \\nadjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements. \\nWe considered unusual journals such as those posted outside \\nof expected hours, or by unexpected individuals and for large or \\nunusual amounts.\\n\\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\\nAdjustments to revenue have been appropriately recognised.\\n\\nRisk \\nFinancial Services customer receivables impairment\\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 60); Accounting policies \\n(page 102); and Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 102)\\n\\nFinancial Services customer receivables relate to Sainsbury’s Bank \\ncredit cards, loans and mortgages; and Argos store cards. Total amounts \\nrecognised at year-end are £7,234 million (2017/2018: £5,844 million). \\nThe provision for impairment is £281 million (2017/2018: £153 million).\\n\\nThe risk of collectability of Financial Services customer receivables, \\nthrough either credit cards, loans, mortgages or Argos store cards, is \\nsignificant. There is judgement in the assumptions applied to calculate \\nthe loan provisions against outstanding balances. Additionally, for the \\ncurrent year, management’s provisioning methodology changed from an \\n“incurred loss” model to an “expected loss” model following the adoption \\nof IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments).\\n\\nOur response to the risk\\n— The loan impairment methodology was reviewed, to confirm it was \\n\\nconsistent with IFRS 9.\\n— We verified the completeness and accuracy of the data utilised from \\n\\nunderlying systems that were used in the impairment models.\\n— We challenged the key assumptions used by management with \\n\\nreference to industry/peer benchmarks and our financial services \\nrisk management specialists.\\n\\n— We tested that the key assumptions had been accurately reflected in the \\nimpairment models.\\n\\n— We independently calculated a reasonable range of outcomes to assess \\nthe provision for high risk segments.\\n\\n— We challenged the macro-economic scenarios, including Brexit scenarios, \\nwith the support of our economic modelling experts.\\n\\n92 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\nIndependent auditor’s report to the members  \\nof J Sainsbury plc continued\\n\\n\\n\\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\\nThe provision for impairment of Financial Services receivables due from \\ncustomers is appropriately recognised.\\n\\nRisk \\nTransition impact on adoption of IFRS 16\\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 60); Accounting policies \\n(page 104); and Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 104)\\n\\nThe calculation of the impact of IFRS 16 is complex. The accounting \\nis complex and requires a number of significant judgements. Further, \\nthe Group has a high volume of leases, some of which have been in place \\nfor a number of years.\\n\\nAlthough the standard is being implemented in 2019/2020, disclosures \\non the impact are included in these financial statements.\\n\\nOur response to the risk\\n— We assessed the completeness of the population of leases and \\n\\nvalidated that all leases had been appropriately uploaded onto \\nthe lease accounting IT application.\\n\\n— We assessed the appropriateness of the incremental borrowing rates, \\nwith the support of our Corporate Treasury specialists.\\n\\n— We challenged the key judgements and assumptions used by \\nmanagement, including those made in relation to the property portfolio.\\n\\n— On a sample basis, we performed testing of lease data input into the \\nlease accounting IT application.\\n\\n— For a sample of leases, we independently modelled the impact \\nof IFRS 16 using our own internally designed tool and compared \\nthe results to the Group’s accounting IT application.\\n\\n— We audited management’s impairment assessment in relation \\nto the right of use asset.\\n\\n— We audited the disclosures provided in the financial statements \\non the impact of IFRS 16.\\n\\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\\nThe right of use asset and lease liability as at 10 March 2018 have been \\nappropriately calculated, with the disclosures correctly reflecting the \\nbalance sheet impact of adopting IFRS 16 as at 10 March 2018.\\n\\nRisk \\nThe IT environment\\nThe IT systems across the Group are complex and there are varying levels \\nof integration between them. The systems are vital to the ongoing operations \\nof the business and to the integrity of the financial reporting process.\\n\\nOur response to the risk\\n— We held discussions with management to understand the IT environment \\n\\nand walked through the key financial processes to understand where IT \\nsystems were integral to the Group’s controls over financial reporting. \\nFrom this we identified which IT systems to include in the scope for our \\ndetailed IT testing.\\n\\n— We assessed the IT general controls environment for the key systems \\nimpacting the accurate recording of transactions and the presentation \\nof the financial statements.\\n\\n— We designed our IT audit procedures to assess the IT environment, \\nincluding an assessment of controls over changes made to the system \\nand controls over appropriate access to the systems.\\n\\n— Where we found that adequate IT general controls were not in place, we \\nperformed additional substantive testing to mitigate the risk of material \\nmisstatement.\\n\\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\\nWe have not identified any misstatements in the financial statements due \\nto the limitations of the IT environment.\\n\\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\\nTailoring the scope\\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation \\nof performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity \\nwithin the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the \\nconsolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the \\norganisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes \\nin the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit \\nresults when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.\\n\\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial \\nstatements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of \\nsignificant accounts in the financial statements, of the 76 reporting \\ncomponents of the Group, we selected 33 reporting components, which \\nrepresent the principal business units within the Group.\\n\\nOf the 33 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete \\nfinancial information of eight components (“full scope components”) which \\nwere selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 25 \\ncomponents (“specific scope components”), we performed audit procedures \\non specific accounts within that component that we considered had the \\npotential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial \\nstatements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\\n\\nOf the remaining balances, none are individually greater than five per cent \\nof the Group’s profit before tax excluding one-off items. For these accounts, \\nwe performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of \\nconsolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any \\npotential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\\n\\nThe table below illustrates the coverage obtained from the work performed \\nby our audit teams.\\n\\n% \\nGroup \\nProfit \\n\\nbefore \\ntax\\n\\n% \\nGroup \\nProfit \\n\\nbefore \\ntax\\n\\n% Group \\nRevenue\\n\\n% Total  \\nassets\\n\\nNumber 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018\\n\\nFull scope 8 42% 46% 99% 99% 75% 74%\\nSpecific scope  25 56% 46% 0% 0% 25% 22%\\nFull and specific \\nscope coverage\\n\\n33 98% 92% 99% 99% 100% 96%\\n\\nRemaining \\ncomponents 43 2% 8% 1% 1% 0% 4%\\nTotal reporting \\ncomponents 76 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\\n\\nInvolvement with component teams\\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined \\nthe type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components \\nby us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors \\nfrom other EY network firms operating under our instruction.

The work at the specific \\nscope locations was performed by EY components in Edinburgh, the Isle \\nof Man and the primary team.\\n\\nFor Sainsbury’s Bank plc and Argos Financial Services, the Senior Statutory \\nAuditor visited these locations and held discussions with management. The \\nteam discussed the audit approach with the component team and significant \\nissues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers on risk \\nareas. The closing discussion was attended by the primary team. This, \\ntogether with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us \\nappropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements. \\nFor the insurance company, the team discussed the audit approach with the \\ncomponent team and interacted regularly with the component team where \\nappropriate during various stages of the audit in order to understand the key \\naudit findings. \\n\\n 93Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\nOur application of materiality\\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, \\nin evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in \\nforming our audit opinion.\\n\\nMateriality\\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in \\nthe aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides \\na basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\\n\\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be £30.5 million, which is \\nfive per cent of profit before tax excluding the items described below. \\nWe believe that this materiality basis provides us with the best assessment \\nof the requirements of the users of the financial statements. This is \\nconsistent with the approach taken in the prior period.\\n\\nStarting basis Profit before tax £239m\\n\\nAdjustments One-off pension costs £100m\\nArgos related non-underlying costs £40m\\nSainsbury’s Bank transition costs £70m\\nPerpetual securities coupon £(23m)\\nOther (mainly Asda related and \\nrestructuring costs)\\n\\n£185m\\n\\nTotal £372m\\nProfit before tax and adjustments £611m\\n\\nMateriality Materiality of £30.5m (5% of profit before tax and after \\nmaking the adjustments noted above)\\n\\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £150 million \\n(2017/18: £155 million), which is two per cent (2017/18: two per cent) of net \\nassets. The materiality of the parent company is greater than the Group \\nbecause the parent company is a holding company with significant net \\nassets. For any parent company balances that are consolidated into the \\nGroup financial statements, an allocation of Group performance materiality \\nwas used. \\n\\nPerformance materiality\\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. \\nIt is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability \\nthat the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements \\nexceeds materiality.\\n\\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the \\nGroup’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance \\nmateriality was approximately 75 per cent (2017/18: 75 per cent) of our \\nplanning materiality, namely £23 million (2017/18: £23 million). We have \\nset performance materiality at this percentage due to our assessment \\nthat the risk of material misstatement is not high.\\n\\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit \\ncoverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken \\nbased on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance \\nmateriality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk \\nof the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the \\nrisk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range \\nof performance materiality allocated to components was £5 million to \\n£18 million (2017/18 : £4 million to £17 million).\\n\\nReporting threshold\\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being \\nclearly trivial.\\n\\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all \\nuncorrected audit differences in excess of £1.5 million (2017/18: £1.5 million), \\nwhich is set at five per cent of planning materiality, as well as differences \\nbelow that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative \\ngrounds.\\n\\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative \\nmeasures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant \\nqualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\\n\\nOther information\\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual \\nReport as set out on pages 1 to 88 other than the financial statements and \\nour auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other \\ninformation.\\n\\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information \\nand, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not \\nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n\\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility \\nis to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other \\ninformation is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our \\nknowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially \\nmisstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material \\nmisstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material \\nmisstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the \\nother information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \\nthat there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are \\nrequired to report that fact.\\n\\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\\n\\nIn this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility \\nto specifically address the following items in the other information and \\nto report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information \\nwhere we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:\\n— Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 90 – the \\n\\nstatement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual \\nReport and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and \\nunderstandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders \\nto assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is \\nmaterially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or\\n\\n— Audit Committee reporting set out on page 60 – the section \\ndescribing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately \\naddress matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or\\n\\n— Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate \\nGovernance Code set out on page 48 – the parts of the Directors’ \\nstatement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s \\ncompliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing \\nprovisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing \\nRule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant \\nprovision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\\n\\nOpinions on other matters prescribed \\nby the Companies Act 2006\\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited \\nhas been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\\n\\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\\n— the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report \\n\\nfor the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared \\nis consistent with the financial statements; and\\n\\n— the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared \\nin accordance with applicable legal requirements.\\n\\n94 Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\nIndependent auditor’s report to the members  \\nof J Sainsbury plc continued\\n\\n\\n\\nMatters on which we are required to report \\nby exception\\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the \\nparent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, \\nwe have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or \\nthe Directors’ Report.\\n\\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to \\nwhich the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\\n— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, \\n\\nor returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches \\nnot visited by us; or\\n\\n— the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ \\nRemuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the \\naccounting records and returns; or\\n\\n— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not \\nmade; or\\n\\n— we have not received all the information and explanations we require \\nfor our audit.\\n\\nResponsibilities of Directors\\nAs explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out \\non page 90, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial \\nstatements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, \\nand for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to \\nenable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\n\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for \\nassessing the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and \\nusing the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either \\nintend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, \\nor have no realistic alternative but to do so.\\n\\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial \\nstatements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \\nfinancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always \\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \\nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of \\nusers taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\n\\nExplanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable \\nof detecting irregularities, including fraud\\nThe objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the \\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to \\nobtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of \\nmaterial misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing \\nappropriate responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected \\nfraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for \\nthe prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with \\ngovernance of the entity and management.\\n\\nOur approach was as follows:\\nWe obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that \\nare applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are:\\n— those that relate to the form and content of the financial statements, \\n\\nsuch as the Group accounting policy, International Financial Reporting \\nStandards (IFRS), the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate \\nGovernance Code;\\n\\n— those that relate to the payment of employees; and\\n— industry related such as compliance with the requirements of the \\n\\nGrocery Supply Code of Practice.\\n\\nWe understood how J Sainsbury plc is complying with those frameworks \\nby observing the oversight of those charged with governance, the culture \\nof honesty and ethical behaviour and a strong emphasis placed on fraud \\nprevention, which may reduce opportunities for fraud to take place, and \\nfraud deterrence, which could persuade individuals not to commit fraud \\nbecause of the likelihood of detection and punishment.\\n\\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to \\nmaterial misstatement, including how fraud might occur by making \\nan assessment of the key fraud risks to the Group and the manner in \\nwhich such risks may manifest themselves in practice, based on our \\nprevious knowledge of the Group as well as an assessment of the current \\nbusiness environment.\\n\\nBased on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to \\nidentify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Where the risk \\nwas considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address \\neach identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual \\njournals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the \\nfinancial statements were free of fraud or error. We evaluated the design \\nand operational effectiveness of controls put in place to address the risks \\nidentified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud. We also \\nconsidered performance targets and their influence on efforts made \\nby management to manage earnings.\\n\\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial \\nstatements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at \\nhttps://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description \\nforms part of our auditor’s report.\\n\\nOther matters we are required to address\\n— Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee we were \\n\\nappointed by the Company at its Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2015. \\nWe have been the statutory auditor since that date.\\n\\n— The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were \\nnot provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain \\nindependent of the Group and the parent company in conducting \\nthe audit.\\n\\n— The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the \\nAudit Committee.\\n\\nUse of our report\\nThis report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in \\naccordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our \\naudit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s \\nmembers those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s \\nreport and for no other purpose.

The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and \\nits registered address is 33 Holborn, London EC1N 2HT, United Kingdom.\\n\\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks to 9 March 2019 (prior financial \\nyear: 52 weeks to 10 March 2018). The consolidated financial statements \\nfor the 52 weeks to 9 March 2019 comprise the financial statements of \\nthe Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and the Group’s share \\nof the post-tax results of its joint ventures and associates.\\n\\nSainsbury’s Bank plc and its subsidiaries have been consolidated for the \\n12 months to 28 February 2019 being the Bank’s year-end date (prior \\nfinancial year: 28 February 2018). Adjustments have been made for the \\neffects of significant transactions or events that occurred between this \\ndate and the Group’s balance sheet date.\\n\\nNectar Loyalty Holding Limited and its subsidiaries have been \\nconsolidated from 1 March 2018 to 9 March 2019 (prior financial year: four \\nweeks to 28 February 2018). Nectar’s year-end date is now aligned with \\nthe Group.\\n\\nThe Group’s principal activities are Food, General Merchandise and Clothing \\nretailing and Financial Services.\\n\\nThe Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the \\nEuropean Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations \\nCommittee (IFRIC) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 \\napplicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.\\n\\nThe financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest \\nmillion (£m) unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared on a going \\nconcern basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative \\nfinancial instruments, defined benefit pension scheme assets, investment \\nproperties and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome that have been measured at fair value.\\n\\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the relevant notes \\nto which the policies relate, and those relating to the financial statements \\nas a whole can be read further below. Significant accounting policies \\nhave been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial \\nstatements.\\n\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group consist of the financial \\nstatements of the ultimate parent company J Sainsbury plc, all entities \\ncontrolled by the Company and the Group’s share of its interests in joint \\nventures and associates.\\n\\na) Subsidiaries\\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the \\nGroup has control. This is when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, \\nvariable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability \\nto affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results \\nof subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of \\nacquisition or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal. \\nIntercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are \\neliminated upon consolidation.\\n\\nSainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership, Sainsbury’s Property Scottish \\nLimited Partnership and Insight 2 Communication LLP, are partnerships \\nwhich are fully consolidated into these Group accounts. The Group has taken \\nadvantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships \\n(‘Accounts’) Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts \\nof these qualifying partnerships to these accounts.\\n\\nb) Joint ventures and associates\\nThe Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, \\ninvestments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations \\nor joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of \\neach investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements \\nand determined them to be joint ventures. The Group’s share of the post-\\ntax results of its joint ventures and associates is included in the income \\nstatement using the equity method of accounting. Where the Group \\ntransacts with a joint venture or associate, profits and losses are eliminated \\nto the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture or associate.\\n\\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance \\nsheet at historical cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share \\nof net assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment.\\n\\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but \\nnot control.\\n\\nInvestment properties held by the Group are those contained within its joint \\nventures with Land Securities Group PLC and The British Land Company \\nPLC. These are properties held for capital appreciation and/or to earn rental \\nincome. They are initially measured at cost, including related transaction \\ncosts. After initial recognition at cost, they are carried at their fair values \\nbased on market value determined by professional valuers at each reporting \\ndate. The difference between the fair value of an investment property at \\nthe reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is \\nincluded within the income statement (within the profit from joint ventures \\nline item) but is excluded from underlying profit in order to provide a clear \\nand consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group’s \\nongoing business for shareholders.\\n\\nForeign currencies\\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which \\nis the ultimate parent company’s functional currency.\\n\\na) Foreign operations\\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated \\ninto sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results of foreign operations \\nare translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.\\n\\nb) Foreign currency transactions\\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the \\nexchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated \\nat the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising \\non translation are recognised in the income statement.\\n\\nAmendments to published standards\\nEffective for the Group and Company in these financial statements:\\n\\nThe Group considered the following amendments to published standards \\nthat are effective for the Group for the financial year beginning 11 March 2018 \\nand concluded that, with the exception of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ \\nand IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, they are either \\nnot relevant to the Group or they do not have a significant impact on the \\nGroup’s financial statements other than disclosures. These standards \\nand interpretations have been endorsed by the European Union.\\n— Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ on the classification \\n\\nand measurement of share-based payment transactions\\n— Amendments to IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ on the transfers \\n\\nof investment property\\n— IFRIC Interpretation 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance \\n\\nConsideration’\\n— Annual Improvements Cycle 2014-2016 (issued in December 2016)\\n— IFRS 4 ‘Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance \\n\\nContracts’\\n— IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’\\n— IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’\\n\\n 101Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Basis of preparation continued\\nFurther information on the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 is included below.\\n\\nStandards and revisions effective for future periods:\\nThe following standards and revisions will be effective for future periods:\\n— IFRS 16 ‘Leases’\\n— IFRIC Interpretation 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’\\n— Amendments to IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ on prepayment features \\n\\nwith negative compensation\\n— Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and IAS 8 \\n\\n‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ \\non the definition of material\\n\\n— Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ on plan amendments, \\ncurtailments or settlements\\n\\n— Amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ \\non long-term interests in associates and joint ventures\\n\\n— Annual Improvements Cycle 2015-2017 (issued in December 2017)\\n\\nThe Group has considered the impact of the remaining above standards \\nand revisions and have concluded that, with the exception of IFRS 16, they \\nwill not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. \\nFurther information on IFRS 16 is included below.\\n\\nTransitional disclosures on adoption of new accounting standards \\nIFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’\\nIFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January \\n2018, bringing together all three aspects of the accounting for financial \\ninstruments: classification and measurement, impairment and hedge \\naccounting. \\n\\nThe main changes the new standard introduces are:\\n— new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial \\n\\nassets and financial liabilities;\\n— a new model for recognising impairments of financial assets; and\\n— changes to hedge accounting by aligning hedge accounting more closely \\n\\nto an entity’s risk management objectives.\\n\\nThe changes have been applied by adjusting the Consolidated Balance \\nSheet at 11 March 2018, the date of initial application, with no restatement \\nof comparative information. In accordance with IFRS 9 transition guidance, \\ncomparative financial information in the primary financial statements \\nremains compliant with the classification and measurement requirements \\nof IAS 39.\\n\\na) Classification and measurement\\nIFRS 9 introduced a principles-based approach to the classification of \\nfinancial assets. Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit \\nor loss (FVPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) \\nor amortised cost. Classification is determined by the nature of the cash \\nflows of the assets and the business model in which they are held. These \\ncategories replace the existing IAS 39 classifications. For financial liabilities, \\nmost of the pre-existing requirements for classification and measurement \\npreviously included in IAS 39 were carried forward unchanged into IFRS 9.\\n\\nAn assessment of the Group’s business models was made as at the date of \\ninitial application on 11 March 2018 and applied prospectively. The changes in \\nclassification resulted in no change in measurement as at 11 March 2018 and \\nare not expected to result in a material impact going forward. A summary of \\nthe respective classifications under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 is presented below:\\n\\nBalance sheet line Periodicity IAS 39 IFRS 9\\n11 March 2018 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nFinancial assets\\nFinancial assets at fair value  \\nthrough other comprehensive income\\n\\nNon-current Available for sale Fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income \\n\\n540\\n\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income\\n\\nCurrent Available for sale Fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income \\n\\n203\\n\\nOther receivables Non-current Loans & receivables Amortised cost 44\\nTrade and other receivables Current Loans & receivables Amortised cost 553\\nTrade and other receivables Current Loans & receivables Fair value through profit and loss1 191\\nCash and cash equivalents Current Loans & receivables Amortised cost 1,580\\nCash and cash equivalents Current Loans & receivables Fair value through profit and loss1 150\\nAmounts due from Financial Services customers Non-current Loans & receivables Amortised cost2 2,332\\nAmounts due from Financial Services customers Current Loans & receivables Amortised cost2 3,360\\nDerivative financial instruments Non-current Fair value through profit and loss Fair value through profit and loss 17\\nDerivative financial instruments Current Fair value through profit and loss Fair value through profit and loss 10\\n\\n1  Travel money and cash in ATMs (including cash on order for ATMs) are considered separately from cash held in banks. With regard to travel money, the business model is ‘held to sell foreign currency \\nto customers’ and the contractual cash flows are ‘margin on foreign exchange rates’. With regard to cash in ATMs, the business model is ‘held to sell ATM services’ and the contractual cash flows are \\n‘ATM fees’. Therefore, both assets are measured at FVPL.\\n\\n2  The balances presented are consistent with those presented as at 10 March 2018. There is a day 1 adjustment to amounts due from Financial Services customers relating to the recognition of expected \\ncredit loss (ECL) provisions under IFRS 9.

As soon \\nas a financial instrument is originated or purchased, 12-month expected \\ncredit losses are recognised in profit and loss and an impairment allowance \\nis established (Stage 1). If the credit risk increases significantly (and the \\nresulting credit quality is not considered to be low credit risk) full lifetime \\nexpected credit losses are provided for (Stage 2). Under both Stage 1 and \\nStage 2, interest income is recognised on the gross carrying value of the \\nfinancial asset. Financial assets move into Stage 3 when they are considered \\nto be credit impaired, i.e. when one or more events has occurred that has \\na detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. \\nStage 3 assets continue to recognise lifetime expected impairment losses \\nand interest income is recognised on the net carrying amount (i.e. gross \\namount less impairment allowance).\\n\\nThe impact of the above is to increase the impairment provisions held within \\nthe Financial Services business as at 11 March 2018 by £101 million, with a \\ncorresponding reduction to retained earnings of £84 million, net of deferred \\ntax of £17 million. The net impact to retained earnings has been segregated \\nwithin the Group statement of changes in equity.\\n\\nThe following table reconciles the aggregate opening movement of \\n£101 million to the relevant line items on the balance sheet:\\n\\nIAS 39 closing \\nbalance\\n\\nRe-\\nmeasurement \\non transition \\n\\nto IFRS 9\\n\\nIFRS 9 \\nopening \\nbalance\\n\\n10 March 2018\\n£m\\n\\n11 March 2018\\n£m\\n\\n11 March 2018\\n£m\\n\\nGross advances 5,824 (15) 5,809\\nImpairment provision (132) (72) (204)\\nAmounts due from Financial \\nServices customers 5,692 (87) 5,605\\n\\nProvisions for loan commitments \\n(within Provisions)\\n\\n– (14) (14)\\n\\nTotal day 1 impact of IFRS 9 (101)\\n\\nDuring the year, the Group has been refining its ECL models to better reflect \\ninformation that was available at the transition date of 11 March 2018. \\nThe refinements made include: \\n— Amending economic scenarios included in the ECL models\\n— Updated cash recovery assumptions\\n— Calibrations of the model to reflect up to date data which was available \\n\\nat 11 March 2018\\n\\nThe above updates have been incorporated as at the transition date and as a \\nresult, the opening balance sheet adjustment of £101 million (£84 million net \\nof tax) differs from that reported at the half year of £80 million (£66 million \\nnet of tax). \\n\\nc) Hedge accounting\\nThe Group has continued to apply the hedge accounting requirements \\nof IAS 39 for its macro hedging relationships (applicable to the Financial \\nServices business) and has adopted IFRS 9 in respect of its micro hedge \\naccounting. Macro hedging concerns using instruments to address an entire \\nbalance sheet, whereas micro hedging focuses on a particular asset/liability \\nrisk. Although the micro hedge accounting requirements under IFRS 9 are \\ngenerally less restrictive, this has not resulted in a material impact on the \\nGroup.\\n\\nIFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’\\nIFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from \\ncontracts with customers and is required for annual periods beginning on \\nor after 1 January 2018. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount \\nthat reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in \\nexchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, and supersedes \\nall current revenue recognition requirements of IFRS.\\n\\nAs reported in the Annual Report for the year ended 10 March 2018, the Group \\nperformed a detailed impact assessment, identifying all current sources of \\nrevenue and analysing the accounting requirements for each under IFRS 15. \\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the full retrospective transition option. \\nFull retrospective adoption of IFRS 15 requires comparatives to be restated in \\norder to present values on a consistent basis. However, having quantified the \\nimpact of IFRS 15, management has assessed this impact as immaterial and \\nhas chosen not to restate the primary statements. The disclosure below sets \\nout the impact of IFRS 15 on prior periods.\\n\\nImpact on the comparative statement of financial position on the adoption \\nof IFRS 15:\\n\\nAdjustment\\n\\n52 weeks to \\n10 March 2018 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nAssets\\nRight of return assets (a) 3\\nLiabilities\\nProvisions (a) (3)\\nDeferred revenue (b) 10\\nEquity\\nRetained earnings (b) (10)\\n\\nImpact on the comparative statement of profit and loss on adoption of \\nIFRS 15:\\n\\nAdjustment\\n\\n52 weeks to \\n10 March 2018 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nRevenue (c) 7\\nCost of sales (c) (7)\\n\\nThere is no impact on gross margin. IFRS 15 does not impact other \\ncomprehensive income, nor is there a material impact on the statement \\nof cash flow. There is a nil impact to both basic and diluted EPS.\\n\\na) Right of return asset and provision\\nUnder IFRS 15, the consideration received from a customer is variable \\nbecause the contract allows the customer to return the products. The Group \\nuses the expected value method to estimate the goods that will be returned \\nbecause this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to \\nwhich the Group will be entitled. The impact upon adoption of IFRS 15 for the \\n52 weeks to 10 March 2018 is a £3 million increase in both the right of return \\nasset and provision. This is considered to be immaterial to the Group results \\nand has not been restated within the comparatives on the statement of \\nfinancial position.\\n\\nb) Nectar\\nOn 1 February 2018, the Group acquired the shares of Aimia Inc’s UK \\nbusiness, enabling the full and independent operation of the Nectar Loyalty \\nprogramme in the UK. From the point of acquisition, any points issued and \\nredeemed in Sainsbury’s and Argos were accounted for in line with IFRIC 13 \\n‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’, meaning a portion of the transaction price \\nwas allocated to the loyalty programme using the fair value of points issued. \\nThere is an immaterial change to the loyalty programme accounting upon \\nthe adoption of IFRS 15.\\n\\n 103Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Basis of preparation continued\\nUnder IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, programme support fees (PSF) for Nectar were \\ndeferred and recognised in line with the issuances and redemption profile of \\nNectar points. However on application of IFRS 15, revenue is disaggregated \\nagainst individual performance obligations. These fees are now recognised \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement with the relevant \\nparty. Applying IFRS 15 retrospectively, the brought forward deferred \\nrevenue balance includes £10 million of PSF relating to prior periods. This \\nbalance has accumulated over many years, with the year-on-year impact \\nconsidered immaterial to the Group. This restatement has been represented \\nas a day 1 adjustment within the statement of changes in equity.\\n\\nc) Agent vs principal\\nFrom time to time the Group enters into contracts with suppliers for which \\nan assessment must be made to determine whether the Group is acting \\nas principal or agent when selling the related goods to customers. In \\nperforming its analysis, the Group identified arrangements where there \\nis a change in the agent/principal classification. The impact to revenue \\nand cost of sales for the 52 weeks to 10 March 2018 is a £7 million reduction. \\nThis is immaterial to the Group results and has not been restated within \\nthe comparatives within the profit and loss statement.\\n\\nIFRS 16 ‘Leases’\\nIFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was issued in January 2016 and introduces a comprehensive \\nmodel for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting \\ntreatments for both lessors and lessees and will supersede the current \\nlease guidance including IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and the related interpretations. \\nThe standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January \\n2019 and will be adopted by Sainsbury’s for the financial year commencing \\n10 March 2019.\\n\\nIFRS 16 distinguishes leases and service contracts on the basis of whether \\nan identified asset is controlled by a customer. The current distinction of \\noperating leases (off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) is \\nremoved for lessee accounting and is replaced by a model where a right-of-\\nuse asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by \\nlessees (i.e. all on balance sheet) except for short-term leases and leases of \\nlow value assets.\\n\\nThe standard represents a significant change in the accounting and \\nreporting of leases, impacting the income statement and balance sheet as \\nwell as statutory and Alternative Performance Measures used by the Group.\\n\\nThe Group has chosen to adopt the fully retrospective approach to transition. \\nThe comparatives in the consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks \\nending 7 March 2020 will be restated as if IFRS 16 had always applied. \\nThe first reporting under IFRS 16 (with restated comparatives) will be \\nfor the Group’s interim results as at 21 September 2019.\\n\\nThe Group has performed an extensive review of all the Group’s leasing \\narrangements in light of the new accounting standard. The work is nearing \\ncompletion and the Group estimates that, had IFRS 16 been applied in the \\n52 weeks ended 10 March 2018, the impact on the consolidated balance \\nsheet as at 10 March 2018 would have been:\\n— Recognition of a right-of-use asset in the region of £5.1 billion disclosed \\n\\nwithin non-current assets \\n— The recognition of a corresponding lease liability in the region \\n\\nof £5.9 billion \\n— Derecognition of other balance sheet items, including onerous leases, \\n\\nrent free accruals and fair value adjustments relating to acquired leases \\nof around £0.1 billion\\n\\n— The above results in an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the \\nregion of £0.9 billion (before adjusting for associated tax impacts) \\n\\nThe above adjustment to retained earnings causes no hindrance \\non the Group’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders. \\n\\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost (being the initial lease \\nliability plus any associated direct costs) and subsequently measured at \\ncost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any \\nre-measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured \\nat the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. \\nSubsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, \\nas well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others. \\n\\nAs a result, the profile of costs recognised in the consolidated income \\nstatement will materially change in comparison to IAS 17 as follows:\\n— Depreciation will increase due to the recognition of right-of-use assets\\n— Existing rental costs will reduce – the only rental costs that remain \\n\\nwill relate to low value assets or short-term leases\\n— Finance costs will increase due to the unwinding of the discount \\n\\non the discounted lease liability\\n\\nWhilst the total cash outflow for leases will not change, the classification \\nof cash flows will be affected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are \\npresented as operating cash flows, whereas under the IFRS 16 model, the \\nlease payments will be split into a principal and an interest portion which \\nwill be presented as financing cash flows.\\n\\nIn preparing for the transition to IFRS 16, the Group has been developing \\nnew controls, policies and governance procedures in several areas that \\ncontribute to the calculation of the overall lease liability and right-of-use \\nasset. These include the identification of any embedded leases, accounting \\nfor lease modifications, as well as electing to not apply IFRS 16 to short-\\nterm leases (less than a year) and low value assets in line with the practical \\nexpedients offered under IFRS 16.\\n\\nKey judgements have also been addressed, including the assessment of \\nhow reasonably certain it is considered to be that a lease option (extension, \\ntermination or purchase) will be exercised, and the determination of an \\nappropriate discount rate used to present value the lease liability and to \\ninitially measure the right-of-use asset. With regards to these, the Group \\nhas determined that the lease term will correspond to the duration of the \\ncontracts except in cases where the Group is reasonably certain that it will \\nexercise contractual extension or break options. The historical discount \\nrates applied have been based on the incremental borrowing rate where \\nthe implicit rate in the lease is not readily determinable.\\n\\nAll relevant accounting policies will be updated to reflect the changes under \\nIFRS 16 in the consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ending \\n7 March 2020.\\n\\n2 Significant accounting judgements, \\nestimates and assumptions\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires \\nthe use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and \\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. \\nThose which are significant to the Group are discussed separately below:\\n\\nJudgements\\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management \\nhas made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect \\non the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:\\n\\na) Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale\\nAt each balance sheet date management assesses whether any assets, \\nwhose carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather \\nthan continued use, meet the definition of held for sale. Where there is an \\nactive plan in place to locate a buyer, management considers such assets \\nto meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale if they are available \\nfor immediate sale and the sale is highly probable.\\n\\nFor more information on the assets and liabilities held for sale, refer \\nto note 17.\\n\\nb) Operating lease commitments\\nThe Group is party to commercial property leases on a number of its stores. \\nAt inception of each lease, the terms and conditions of the arrangements \\nare evaluated to assess whether the lease terms constitute a major part \\nof the economic life of the assets and whether the present value of the \\nminimum lease payments amount to substantially all of the fair value of \\nthe commercial property. Where there is no evidence of this, management \\nconcludes that all the significant risks and rewards of ownership do not \\ntransfer to the Group and these leases are accounted for as operating leases. \\nFurther information about committed operating lease payments is included \\nin note 33.\\n\\n104 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Significant accounting judgements, \\nestimates and assumptions continued\\nc) Consolidation of structured entities\\nA structured entity is one in which the Group does not hold the majority \\ninterest but for which management has concluded that voting rights are \\nnot the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. In making \\nsuch an assessment, management considers the terms of the arrangement \\nto assess who has responsibility for the management of the entity and its \\nassets. Where the Group has this responsibility, it is deemed that the Group \\ncontrols the entity and it is fully consolidated into the Group accounts. \\nThe structured entities applicable to the Group are Sainsbury’s Property \\nScottish Partnership and Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership.\\n\\nd) Aggregation of operating segments\\nManagement has determined the operating segments based on the \\ninformation provided to the Operating Board (the Chief Operating Decision \\nMaker for the Group) to make operational decisions on the management \\nof the Group. Four operating segments were identified as follows:\\n— Retail – Food\\n— Retail – General Merchandise and Clothing\\n— Financial Services\\n— Property Investment\\n\\nManagement has considered the economic characteristics, similarity of \\nproducts, production processes, customers, sales methods and regulatory \\nenvironment of its two Retail segments. In doing so it has been concluded \\nthat they should be aggregated into one ‘Retail’ segment in the financial \\nstatements. This aggregated information provides users with the financial \\ninformation needed to evaluate the business and the environment in \\nwhich it operates.\\n\\nEstimates and assumptions\\nThe areas where estimates and assumptions are significant to the \\nfinancial statements are as described below. The estimates and associated \\nassumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors \\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results \\nof which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values \\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. \\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\\n\\na) Impairment of non-financial assets\\nThe Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any \\nimpairment loss, based on the recoverable amount of the cash-generating \\nunit (CGU) or group of CGUs to which it is allocated. The recoverable amounts \\nof the CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations and \\nthese calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash \\nflows and suitable discount rates, as disclosed in note 12. Actual outcomes \\ncould vary from these estimates.\\n\\nNon-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether \\ncurrent or future events and circumstances suggest that their recoverable \\namount may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based \\non the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to dispose. Value \\nin use is calculated from expected future cash flows using suitable discount \\nrates and includes management assumptions and estimates of future \\nperformance.\\n\\nb) Impairment of loans and advances\\nImpairment loss models involve the estimation of future cash flows of \\nfinancial assets, based on observable data at the balance sheet date and \\nhistorical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. \\nThis will typically take into account the level of arrears, security, past loss \\nexperience and default levels. These calculations are undertaken on a \\nportfolio basis using various statistical modelling techniques. Impairment \\nmodels are continually reviewed to ensure data and assumptions are \\nappropriate with the most material assumption being around expected \\nloss rates.\\n\\nc) Post-employment benefits\\nThe Group operates one defined benefit scheme for employees, segregated \\ninto two sections – the Sainsbury’s section and the Argos section. The \\npresent value of the scheme’s liabilities recognised at the balance sheet \\ndate and the net financing charge recognised in the income statement are \\ndependent on the discount rate applied which is derived from the expected \\nyields on high quality corporate bonds over the duration of the Group’s \\npension scheme. High quality corporate bonds are those which at least one \\nof the main ratings agencies considers to be at least AA (or equivalent).\\n\\nOther key assumptions within this calculation are based on market \\nconditions or estimates of future events, including mortality rates, as set \\nout in note 30. The carrying value of the retirement benefit obligations will \\nbe impacted by changes to any of the assumptions used, however is most \\nsensitive to changes in the discount rate. Sensitivities to movements in the \\ndiscount rate are included in note 30.\\n\\nd) Provisions\\nProvisions have been made for onerous leases, onerous contracts, \\ndilapidations, restructuring, insurance and long service awards. These \\nprovisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future cash \\nflows are dependent on future events and market conditions. Any difference \\nbetween expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted \\nfor in the period when such determination is made. The carrying amount \\nof provisions will be impacted by changes in the discount rate. Details \\nof provisions are set out in note 19.\\n\\ne) Determining fair values\\nThe fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available \\nfrom the market on which the instruments are traded. Where market values \\nare not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been \\ncalculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest \\nrates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, overdrafts \\nand payables are assumed to approximate to their book values.\\n\\nf)  Revenue recognition – Fair value of Nectar points\\nThe Group estimates the fair value of points awarded under the Nectar \\nprogramme by reference to the value per point to a customer, multiplied \\nby expected breakage assumptions. Breakage represents management’s \\nestimate of points issued that will never be redeemed. As points issued \\nunder the programme do not expire, such estimates are subject to \\nuncertainty. Breakage is estimated by management based on the terms \\nand conditions of membership and historical accumulation and redemption \\npatterns, and adjusted for changes to any terms and conditions that may \\naffect members’ redemption patterns. \\n\\nIf the breakage estimate used in determining the deferred revenue for the \\nGroup had been 0.5 per cent lower, the deferred points liability would have \\nbeen £19 million higher. If the breakage estimate had been 0.5 per cent \\nhigher, the deferred points liability would have been £19 million lower. \\n\\ng) Supplier arrangements\\nSupplier incentives, rebates and discounts, collectively known as ‘supplier \\narrangements’, represent a material deduction to cost of sales and directly \\naffect the Group’s reported margin. The arrangements can be complex, with \\namounts spanning multiple products over different time periods, and there \\ncan be multiple triggers and discounts. The accrued value at the reporting \\ndate is included in trade receivables or trade payables, depending on the \\nright of offset. A description of the different types of supplier arrangements, \\nand their values for the year, are provided in note 5.\\n\\n 105Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n3 Non-GAAP performance measures \\nIn order to provide shareholders with additional insight into the underlying performance of the business, items recognised in reported profit or loss before \\ntax which, by virtue of their size and or nature, do not reflect the Group’s underlying performance are excluded from the Group’s underlying results.

All material operations and assets are in the UK. \\nThe financial year ended 9 March 2019 includes Nectar results from 1 March 2018 to 9 March 2019 (prior financial year: four weeks).\\n\\nSegment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. \\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.\\n\\nRevenue consists of sales through retail outlets and online and, in the case of Financial Services, interest receivable, fees and commissions and excludes \\nValue Added Tax. Revenue is recognised when the Group has a contract with a customer and a performance obligation has been satisfied, at the transaction \\nprice allocated to that performance obligation. Further information on the impact of adopting IFRS 15 is included in note 1.\\n\\nAccounting policies\\nRevenue\\na) Retail – sale of goods\\nFor sales through retail outlets and online, the transaction price is the value of the goods, net of returns, colleague discounts, vouchers and sales made \\non an agency basis. Revenue is recognised when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is when the transaction is completed in-store or, for \\nonline orders, when goods have been delivered. Commission income is recognised in revenue based on the terms of the contract.\\n\\nb) Nectar points\\nAny points issued and redeemed in Sainsbury’s and Argos are accounted for in line with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. On issuance \\nof Nectar points within the Group, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty programme using the fair value of points issued and \\ncorresponding deferred revenue recognised in relation to points issued but not yet redeemed. The deferral is treated as a deduction from revenue. \\nThe fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the fair value to the customer and considers factors such as breakage and the money \\noff that each point entitles a customer to. Deferred revenue is subsequently recognised when Nectar points are redeemed.\\n\\nc) Other income\\nOther income generally consists of profits and losses on disposal of assets. Nectar revenue earned from non-Sainsbury’s redemption partners is included \\nwithin other income and recognised once points have been redeemed. \\n\\nd) Financial Services interest receivable\\nInterest income is recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. This calculation \\ntakes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the \\nexpected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.\\n\\ne) Financial Services fees and commissions\\nFees and commissions that are not integral to the effective interest rate calculation relate primarily to certain credit card and storecard fees, ATM interchange \\nfees, insurance introduction commission and warranty commission receivable. These are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis as \\nservices are provided. Where in the case of insurance commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit share, both are recognised on \\ncompletion of the service to the extent reliably measurable. Where there is a risk of potential clawback, an appropriate element of the commission receivable \\nis deferred and amortised over the clawback period. Where the relevant contract requires Financial Services to perform future services in respect of the \\nincome receivable, initial commission is recognised on completion of the service provided, with an element deferred to reflect services yet to be performed \\nin future periods.\\n\\nf) Financial Services other operating income\\nMargin from the sale of travel money, representing the difference between the cost price and the selling price, is recognised when the sale to the customer \\ntakes place within other operating income.\\n\\nSegment revenue presents a disaggregation of revenue from customers consistent with the Group’s primary revenue streams.\\n\\n108 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Segment reporting continued\\nIncome statement and balance sheet\\n\\n52 weeks to 9 March 2019\\nRetail \\n\\n£m\\n\\nFinancial \\nServices \\n\\n£m\\n\\nProperty \\nInvestment \\n\\n£m\\nGroup \\n\\n£m\\n\\nSegment revenue\\nRetail sales to external customers 28,466 – – 28,466\\nFinancial Services to external customers1 – 541 – 541\\nUnderlying revenue 28,466 541 – 29,007\\nRevenue 28,466 541 – 29,007\\n\\nUnderlying operating profit 692 31 – 723\\nUnderlying finance income 3 – – 3\\nUnderlying finance costs (99) – – (99)\\nUnderlying share of post-tax profit from joint ventures and associates – – 8 8\\nUnderlying profit before tax 596 31 8 635\\nNon-underlying expense (note 3) (396)\\nProfit before tax 239\\nIncome tax expense (note 8) (20)\\nProfit for the financial period 219\\n \\nAssets 14,420 8,916 – 23,336\\nInvestment in joint ventures and associates – – 205 205\\nSegment assets 14,420 8,916 205 23,541\\nSegment liabilities (7,147) (7,938) – (15,085)\\n\\nOther segment items\\nCapital expenditure2 585 44 – 629\\nDepreciation expense3 642 7 – 649\\nAmortisation expense4 127 16 – 143\\nNet impairment and onerous contract charge 3 – – 3\\nShare-based payments 36 3 – 39\\n\\n1 Financial Services income includes £385 million recognised using the effective interest rate method.\\n2  Retail capital expenditure consists of property, plant and equipment additions of £505 million and intangible asset additions of £80 million.

The arrangements can be complex, with amounts spanning multiple products over different time periods, and there can be \\nmultiple triggers and discounts. The accrued value at the reporting date is included in trade receivables or trade payables, depending on the right of offset. \\nThe four key types are as follows:\\n— Discounts and supplier incentives – these represent the majority of all supplier arrangements and are linked to individual unit sales. The incentive is \\n\\ntypically based on an agreed sum per item sold on promotion for a period and therefore is considered part of the purchase price of that product.\\n— Fixed amounts – these are agreed with suppliers primarily to support in-store activity including promotions, such as utilising specific space. These involve \\n\\na degree of judgement and estimation in ensuring the appropriate cut-off of arrangements for fixed amounts which span period-end. These require \\njudgement to determine when the terms of the arrangement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period. \\n\\n— Supplier rebates – these are typically agreed on an annual basis, aligned with the Group’s financial year. The rebate amount is linked to pre-agreed targets \\nsuch as sales volumes and requires estimates of the amount earned up to the balance sheet date, for each relevant supplier contract. Where agreements \\nspan a financial period-end, estimations are required of projected turnover and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level \\nearned as agreements may involve multiple tiers. In order to minimise any risk arising from estimation, agreements from suppliers are obtained to agree \\nthe value to be recognised at year-end, prior to it being invoiced. By aligning the agreements to the Group’s financial year, where possible, the judgements \\nrequired are minimised.\\n\\n— Marketing and advertising income – relates to income which is directly linked to the cost of producing the Argos catalogue as well as advertising income \\nfrom suppliers through the Group’s subsidiary Insight 2 Communication (I2C). Income relating to the Argos catalogue is recognised once agreed with the \\nsupplier and when the catalogue is made available to the Group, which is the point at which the catalogue costs are recognised.

This results in a total final proposed dividend of £174 million (2018: £156 million), an increase of 11.5 per cent on the previous year. \\nSubject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 12 July 2019 to the shareholders on the register at 7 June 2019. \\nThe proposed final dividend has not been included as a liability at 9 March 2019. \\n\\n11 Property, plant and equipment\\nAccounting policies\\na) Land and buildings\\nLand and buildings are held at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Capital work in progress is held \\nat cost less any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs to bringing the asset to its working \\ncondition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.\\n\\nb) Fixtures and equipment\\nFixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original \\npurchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use.\\n\\nc) Depreciation\\nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line basis, using the following rates:\\n— Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease term if shorter\\n— Fixtures, equipment and vehicles – three to 15 years\\n— Freehold land is not depreciated\\n\\nCapital work in progress is not depreciated.\\n\\nGains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds less any associated costs of disposal with the asset’s carrying amount and are \\nrecognised within operating profit.\\n\\nThe assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\\n\\nImpairment of non-financial assets\\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that \\nthose assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs \\nto dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.\\n\\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating \\nunit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. For Retail property, plant and equipment, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store, store pipeline development \\nsite or in the case of Argos a cluster of stores. Non-store assets, including depots and IT assets, are reviewed separately, whilst Financial Services is deemed \\na separate CGU.\\n\\nAny impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses due to a change \\nin the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less \\nnotional accumulated depreciation if lower.\\n\\nCapitalisation of interest\\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief.\\n\\nLeased assets\\nLeases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases \\nare classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.\\n\\na) Finance leases\\nAssets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or \\nthe lease term. The amount capitalised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term. \\nThe resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges. Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement.\\n\\nb) Lease incentives\\nLease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term.\\n\\nc) Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases\\nThe Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases. These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term \\nof the lease.\\n\\n118 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n11 Property, plant and equipment continued\\nLand and \\nbuildings \\n\\n£m\\n\\nFixtures and \\nequipment \\n\\n£m\\nTotal \\n\\n£m\\n\\nCost\\nAt 11 March 2018 10,577 5,092 15,669\\nAdditions 68 445 513\\nDisposals (87) (384) (471)\\nAt 9 March 2019 10,558 5,153 15,711\\n    \\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment    \\nAt 11 March 2018 2,657 3,114 5,771\\nDepreciation expense for the year 188 461 649\\nImpairment loss for the year 2 1 3\\nDisposals (42) (378) (420)\\nAt 9 March 2019 2,805 3,198 6,003\\n \\nNet book value at 9 March 2019 7,753 1,955 9,708\\n \\nCapital work-in-progress included above 135 107 242\\n    \\nCost    \\nAt 12 March 2017 10,445 5,084 15,529\\nAcquisition of subsidiaries (note 32) – 3 3\\nAdditions 189 389 578\\nDisposals (56) (384) (440)\\nTransfer to assets held for sale (1) – (1)\\nAt 10 March 2018 10,577 5,092 15,669\\n    \\nAccumulated depreciation and impairment    \\nAt 12 March 2017 2,494 3,029 5,523\\nDepreciation expense for the year 199 460 659\\nDisposals (36) (375) (411)\\nAt 10 March 2018 2,657 3,114 5,771\\n    \\nNet book value at 10 March 2018 7,920 1,978 9,898\\n    \\nCapital work-in-progress included above 250 78 328\\n\\n 119Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n11 Property, plant and equipment continued\\nInterest capitalised\\nInterest capitalised included in additions amounted to £6 million (2018: £7 million) for the Group.

Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually \\nand again whenever indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.\\n\\nb) Computer software\\nComputer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally acquired computer software and software \\nlicences are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to fifteen years. Costs relating to development of computer software \\nfor internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38, ‘Intangible Assets’ are met. Other development expenditures that do not meet these \\ncriteria are expensed as incurred. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful \\neconomic lives of five to fifteen years within administrative expenses.\\n\\nc) Acquired intangible assets\\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with finite useful economic lives \\nare carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful \\neconomic lives, ranging from three to ten years, within administrative expenses.\\n\\nImpairment of non-financial assets\\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets \\nhave suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose \\nand its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.\\n\\nAny impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss \\non goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate \\nof its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less notional accumulated depreciation if lower.\\n\\n.\\n\\n120 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n12 Intangible assets continued\\n\\n \\nGoodwill\\n\\n£m\\n\\nComputer \\nsoftware\\n\\n£m\\n\\nAcquired \\nbrands\\n\\n£m\\n\\nCustomer \\nrelationships \\n\\n£m\\nTotal\\n\\n£m\\n\\nCost     \\nAt 11 March 2018 401 525 230 32 1,188\\nAdditions – 116 – – 116\\nDisposals (1) (23) – – (24)\\nAt 9 March 2019 400 618 230 32 1,280\\n \\nAccumulated amortisation and impairment\\nAt 11 March 2018 4 44 66 2 116\\nAmortisation expense for the year – 100 23 20 143\\nDisposals – (23) – – (23)\\nAt 9 March 2019 4 121 89 22 236\\n \\nNet book value at 9 March 2019 396 497 141 10 1,044\\n     \\n     \\nCost     \\nAt 12 March 2017 254 429 218 – 901\\nAcquisition of subsidiaries (note 32) 147 13 12 32 204\\nAdditions – 139 – – 139\\nDisposals – (56) – – (56)\\nAt 10 March 2018 401 525 230 32 1,188\\n     \\nAccumulated amortisation and impairment     \\nAt 12 March 2017 4 50 44 – 98\\nAmortisation expense for the year – 48 22 2 72\\nDisposals – (54) – – (54)\\nAt 10 March 2018 4 44 66 2 116\\n     \\nNet book value at 10 March 2018 397 481 164 30 1,072\\n\\nGoodwill comprises the following:\\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nJacksons Stores Limited 46 47\\nHome Retail Group 119 119\\nSainsbury’s Bank plc 45 45\\nNectar 147 147\\nBells Stores Limited 16 16\\nOther 23 23\\n 396 397\\n\\nThe goodwill balances above are allocated to the respective cash-generating units (CGUs) or group of CGUs within the Retail or Financial Services segments. \\nThe CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated and the level at which it is monitored in the retailing segment are deemed to be the respective acquired retail \\nchains of stores, whilst Financial Services is a separate CGU.

The goodwill \\narising on the purchases of Home Retail Group and Nectar have been allocated to the Retail segment.\\n\\nThe value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU or group \\nof CGUs with the carrying value of its goodwill. The calculation of the Retail CGU’s value in use is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by \\nthe stores using the latest budget and forecast data. Estimates of sales and costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the \\nmarket. Board approved cash flow projections for five years are used and then extrapolated out assuming flat cash flows and discounted at a pre-tax rate \\nof nine per cent (2018: nine per cent) over the earlier of a 25-year period (being the estimated average remaining useful life of a freehold store) or lease length \\nfor leasehold stores. \\n\\nGoodwill balances relating to Financial Services, Home Retail Group and Nectar are calculated using Board approved cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate \\nof nine per cent (2018: nine per cent) over a four-year period and then into perpetuity. \\n\\n 121Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n12 Intangible assets continued\\nBased on the operating performance of the CGUs, an impairment of goodwill of £nil million was identified in the current financial year (2018: £nil million). \\nThe valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in any impairment of goodwill. \\nSensitivity analysis on the impairment tests for each group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated has been performed.

Provisions are measured at the present value \\nof the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value \\nof money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. \\n\\nOnerous lease and contract provisions\\nThe need for provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, is assessed when the leased property becomes vacant and is no longer \\nused in the operations of the business or when the leased property relates to an unprofitable trading store. Provisions for dilapidation costs are recognised \\non a lease-by-lease basis.\\n\\nProvisions for onerous leases are recognised where expected cash outflows exceed the anticipated future benefits. The amounts provided are based on the \\nGroup’s best estimate of the likely committed outflow, net of anticipated future benefits and after any impairment of pipeline development site assets where \\napplicable.\\n\\nThe onerous lease provision covers residual lease commitments of up to an average of 34 years (2018: 34 years), after allowance for existing or anticipated \\nsublet rental income. \\n\\nInsurance provisions\\nThe provision relates to the Group’s outstanding insurance claims liabilities in relation to public and employer’s liability claims, and third party motor claims. \\nClaims provisions are based on assumptions regarding past claims experience and on assessments by an independent actuary and are intended to provide \\na best estimate of the most likely or expected outcome.\\n\\nRestructuring provisions\\nA restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those \\naffected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement \\nof a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring. The charge for the year is driven by the announced \\ntransformational changes to the Group’s in-store operating model, responding to changing customer shopping habits and reducing costs throughout the \\nstore estate.\\n\\nFinancial services related provisions\\nFinancial services related provisions are primarily in relation to Argos Financial Services customers in respect of potential redress payable arising from \\nthe historic sales of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), and in respect of potential customer redress payable in relation to other customer conduct issues \\narising from a review of the governance and risk management framework.

Accordingly any \\nperiodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time it becomes obligated to pay the periodic return. \\nAny associated tax impacts are recognised directly in equity.\\n\\nOn 30 July 2015 the Group issued £250 million of perpetual subordinated capital securities and £250 million of perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, \\ncollectively known as perpetual securities. Costs directly associated with the issue of £6 million were offset against the value of the proceeds. The securities \\nare perpetual with no fixed redemption date. Holders of the perpetual securities do not benefit from any put option rights; however the Group does have the \\nright to call the perpetual subordinated capital securities at their principal amount on 30 July 2020, and the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds on \\n30 July 2021. The perpetual subordinated convertible bonds may be converted into ordinary shares of the Company at the option of the holders at any time \\nup to 23 July 2021 at a conversion price of 307.9443 pence.\\n\\nThe Group has the right to defer coupons on the perpetual securities on any coupon payment date where the Company has not either paid a dividend \\non its ordinary shares or bought back ordinary shares (excluding shares bought to satisfy employee share schemes) within the previous 12-month period. \\nThe coupon rate on the perpetual subordinated capital securities increases after the fifth anniversary and for the perpetual subordinated convertible bonds \\nafter the sixth anniversary.\\n\\n128 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n22 Perpetual securities continued\\nThe next coupon date on the perpetual securities is 30 July 2019.

The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance by identifying \\nfinancial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls. The risk management policies also ensure sufficient liquidity is available to the Group \\nto meet foreseeable financial obligations and that cash assets are invested safely.\\n\\nFinancial risk management with respect to Financial Services is separately managed within the Financial Services’ governance structure. The risks are more \\nfully described in the Financial Services section on page 135. \\n\\nThe Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures, and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposures. \\nThe use of financial derivatives is governed by Board approved policies which prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\\n\\nLiquidity risk\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\\n\\nThe principal operational cash flow of the Group is largely stable and predictable reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector and the \\ncyclical profile of the non-food retail sector. Cash flow forecasts are produced to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements. The Group’s \\nliquidity policy sets a minimum funding headroom of £400 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12-month time horizon. The Group manages its \\nliquidity risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and holding contingent committed credit facilities.\\n\\nIn June 2018 the £1,450m RCF was extended by one year. The £1,450m facility is split into two facilities, a £300 million Facility (A) maturing in April 2024 and \\na £1,150 million Facility (B) consisting of three tranches; a £300 million tranche A maturing October 2021, a £400 million tranche B maturing October 2022 \\nand a £450 tranche C maturing October 2023. As at 9 March 2019, £35 million had been drawn (2018: £nil). \\n\\nIn December 2018, a new £100 million uncommitted facility was agreed to provide an additional capacity to fund short-term working capital requirements. \\nDrawdowns on this facility bear interest at a margin over LIBOR. The uncommitted facility was £100 million drawn at 9 March 2019 (2018: £nil).\\n\\nThe table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date. \\nThe amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows or an estimate of cash flows in respect of floating interest rate liabilities.\\n\\nGroup\\n\\nLess than one \\nyear \\n\\n£m\\n\\nOne to  \\ntwo years \\n\\n£m\\n\\nTwo to  \\nfive years \\n\\n£m\\n\\nMore than \\nfive years \\n\\n£m\\n\\nAt 9 March 2019\\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\\nSecured loans:\\n Loan due 20311 (71) (73) (236) (619)\\nUnsecured loans:\\n Bank overdraft (1) – – –\\n Short-term borrowings (135) – – –\\n Bank loans due 20192 (199) – – –\\n Convertible bond due 2019 (450) – – –\\nFinance lease obligations2 (23) (13) (37) (202)\\nTrade and other payables (4,187) – – –\\nAmounts due to Financial Services customers and banks5 (5,836) (738) (1,086) (2)\\nDerivative contracts – net settled \\nCommodity contracts 1 – – –\\nInterest rate swaps in hedging relationships1, 4 – 1 7 –\\nDerivative contracts – gross settled\\nForeign exchange forwards – outflow3 (1,342) (63) – –\\nForeign exchange forwards – inflow3 1,351 64 – –\\nCommodity contracts – outflow (11) (11) (21) (22)\\nCommodity contracts – inflow 11 11 20 26\\n\\n130 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n24 Financial risk management continued\\nLess than one \\n\\nyear \\n£m\\n\\nOne to two \\nyears \\n\\n£m\\n\\nTwo to five \\nyears \\n\\n£m\\n\\nMore than \\n five years \\n\\n£m\\n\\nAt 10 March 2018\\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\\nSecured loans:\\n Loan due 2018 (575) – – –\\n Loan due 20311 (68) (71) (227) (698)\\nUnsecured loans:\\n Bank overdraft (2) – – –\\n Bank loans due 20192 (4) (202) – –\\n Convertible bond due 2019 (6) (453) – –\\nFinance lease obligations2 (37) (18) (27) (203)\\nTrade and other payables (4,037) – – –\\nAmounts due to Financial Services customers and banks5 (4,841) (722) (1,205) –\\nDerivative contracts – net settled \\nCommodity contracts 1 – – –\\nInterest rate swaps in hedging relationships1, 4 7 8 8 –\\nDerivative contracts – gross settled\\nForeign exchange forwards – outflow3 (1,366) (69) – –\\nForeign exchange forwards – inflow3 1,323 68 – –\\nCommodity contracts – outflow (15) (26) (25) (4)\\nCommodity contracts – inflow 13 20 22 5\\n\\nAssumptions:\\n1  Cash flows relating to debt and swaps linked to inflation rates have been calculated using an RPI of 4.0 per cent for the year ended 9 March 2019, 2.6 per cent for the year ending 9 March 2020 and \\n\\n3.4 per cent for future years (2018: RPI of 2.6 per cent for the year ended 10 March 2018, 2.7 per cent for the year ending 9 March 2019 and 2.7 per cent for future years).\\n2 Cash flows relating to debt bearing a floating interest rate have been calculated using prevailing interest rates as at 9 March 2019 and 10 March 2018.\\n3 Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated using spot rates as at 9 March 2019 and 10 March 2018.\\n4  The swap rate that matches the remaining term of the interest rate swap as at 9 March 2019 has been used to calculate the floating rate cash flows over the life of the interest rate swaps shown above \\n\\n(2018: 10 March 2018).\\n5  Cash flows relating to amounts due to Sainsbury’s Bank customers and banks are calculated using contractual terms and interest rates for fixed rate instruments.

The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £9,485 million (2018: £8,814 million), equivalent to the Group’s total financial assets and \\ncommitments, and of this amount £8,891 million relates to Financial Services (2018: £7,798 million). \\n\\nThe Group (excluding Financial Services) sets counterparty limits for each of its banking and investment counterparties based on their credit ratings. The \\nminimum unsecured long-term credit rating accepted by the Group is BBB- (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) or Baa3 (Moody’s) or, in the case of sterling liquidity \\nfunds, AAA or Aaa/MR1+ from Moody’s. In the event of a split credit rating, the lower rating applies.\\n\\nThe table below analyses the Group’s cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash, cash in transit and cash at ATMs.\\n\\nCounterparty Long-term rating\\n\\nGroup \\n2019 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nGroup \\n2018 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nFinancial institutions – Money market funds AAAm/Aaa – 299\\nFinancial institutions – Money market deposits AAAm/Aaa 84 30\\nFinancial institutions – Money market deposits AA+/Aa1 to A/A2 120 66\\nDeposits at central banks AA+/Aa1 308 683\\n\\nManagement does not expect any losses arising from non-performance of deposit counterparties.\\n\\n 131Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n24 Financial risk management continued\\nInterest rate swaps, forward contracts and commodity contracts are used by the Group to hedge interest rate, foreign currency and fuel exposures.

Highly probable future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis using \\nforeign currency forward contracts.\\n\\nThe Group has exposure to currency risk on balances held in foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing \\ndifferences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments. \\n\\nThe Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility.

The Group’s interest rate policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating interest and inflation rates \\nby maintaining a diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and variable capped rate liabilities. \\n\\nInterest on financial instruments is classified as fixed rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings are less frequent than once every 12 months. Interest on \\nfinancial instruments is classified as floating rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings occur every 12 months or more frequently.

We seek to ensure that we \\ncan meet our financial obligations at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.\\n\\nThe annual Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) enables the Bank to:\\n1. Identify and assess its most relevant liquidity risk drivers \\n2. Quantify its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios and \\n3. Put in place appropriate controls to mitigate liquidity risks. \\n\\nIn meeting its internal limits as well as PRA requirements, the Bank maintains a stock of high quality liquid assets that can be readily monetised by outright \\nsale or repurchase agreement to meet the Bank’s obligations to depositors and other creditors.\\n\\n 135Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n24 Financial risk management continued\\nThe Bank’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are regularly monitored and forecast alongside cash flow and funding ratios. \\nWe prepare long-term and short-term forecasts to assess liquidity requirements, taking into account factors such as ATM cash management, contractual \\nmaturities and customer deposit patterns (stable or less stable deposits) as well as outflows regarding undrawn commitments. These reports support daily \\nliquidity management, with early warning indicators reviewed on a daily basis and appropriate triggers for escalation and action in line with the risk appetite, \\nLiquidity and Funding Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan. Asset encumbrance ratios and risk indicators for wholesale funding concentrations by type \\n(total/secured/unsecured), maturity, sector, geography and counterparty are also regularly monitored and reported to ALCO.\\n\\nMarket risk \\nMarket risk is the risk that the value of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, capital and earnings are exposed to the adverse change of the market risk drivers. \\nThe Bank’s market risks include Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and foreign exchange (FX) risk. The Bank does not have a trading book.\\n\\na) Interest rate risk\\nIRRBB arises from interest rates movements which impact present value and timing of future cash flows resulting in changes the underlying value of a \\nbank’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and hence its economic value. Interest rates movements also affect a bank’s earnings by altering \\ninterest-sensitive income and expenses, affecting its net interest income.\\n\\nThe main types of interest rate risk faced by the Bank are:\\n— Re-pricing gap risk: the risk arising from timing differences in the interest rate changes of bank assets and liabilities (e.g. fixed rate personal loans \\n\\nand instant access savings accounts).\\n— Yield curve risk: the risk arising from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve.\\n— Basis risk: risk arising from imperfect correlation between different interest rate indices (e.g. administered rate on savings products and treasury assets \\n\\nlinked to LIBOR).\\n— Prepayment risk: the risk arising from the timing of customer prepayments which differ from planning and hedging assumptions.\\n— Pipeline risk: the risk of a customer drawing down, or not, a product at a rate which is unfavourable for the Bank.\\n— Swap spread risk: the Bank holds a portfolio of liquid assets that are hedged using interest rate swaps; there is a risk that the yield on the assets \\n\\nand the swaps do not move in line together resulting in loss.\\n\\nInterest risk exposure is actively managed within limits that are aligned with the Bank’s risk appetite by using financial instruments such as interest rate \\nswaps and by taking into account natural hedges between assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics. Hedging strategies are implemented \\nand reviewed to ensure the Bank remains within its limits.\\n\\nIn order to measure the exposure to interest rate risk under various interest rates shock scenarios, the Bank uses both economic value and earnings-based \\nmetrics: Market Value Sensitivity and Earnings at Risk. These metrics are monthly monitored and reported to the Asset and Liability Committee.\\n\\nFor interest rate risk measurement, products are allocated within re-pricing gap analysis based on their nearest re-pricing date (all non-maturing deposits \\nare assumed to re-price in month one) and Personal Loans are allocated according to behavioural repayment profile.\\n\\nb) Foreign exchange risk\\nThe Bank is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euro and US dollar, within its travel money bureaux \\nin J Sainsbury’s stores. The FX positions are hedged on a daily basis.\\n\\nCredit risk\\nCredit risk is central to the Bank’s day to day activities and is managed in line with the Board approved risk appetite. Key developments over the course of the \\nyear have been the migration of the Credit Card portfolio from LBG to the New Bank programme systems and processes, and the extension of our Mortgage \\nrange to include Buy-to-Let and a First Time Buyer proposition. The Bank has also adopted the new IFRS 9 financial reporting standard, utilising the suite of \\nmodels developed to support this. Compared to the prior year, the Bank’s personal loan cut-offs have been raised as a precautionary measure against future \\neconomic variability. \\n\\nRetail Credit Risk\\nRetail Credit Risk is the possibility of losses arising from a retail customer failing to meet their agreed repayment terms as they fall due. Retail Credit utilise \\nautomated scorecards to assess the credit worthiness and affordability criteria of new applicants and ongoing behavioural characteristics of existing \\ncustomers. The outcomes from all scorecard models are monitored utilising a set of credit quality metrics to ensure actual performance is in line with agreed \\nexpectations. Additional expert underwriting of credit applications is undertaken by a specialist operational team where further consideration is appropriate.\\n\\nThe Retail Credit Risk Committee provide portfolio oversight control over credit strategy to maintain lending in line with the Board approved risk appetite, \\nwith additional oversight and control provided by the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. Internal Audit provide additional assurance by \\nundertaking regular reviews on the adequacy of credit risk policies and procedures.\\n\\nWholesale and derivative credit risk\\nThe Bank’s treasury portfolio is held primarily for liquidity management purposes and in the case of derivatives, for the purpose of managing market risk. \\nThe liquidity portfolio is invested in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and internal Operational \\nLiquidity Pool (OLP). These investments include the Bank of England’s (BoE) reserve account, UK government securities (gilts or Treasury bills), multilateral \\ndevelopment bank securities, government guaranteed agency securities, UK regulated covered bond programmes and asset backed securities. \\n\\nLimits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity. Consideration is also given \\nto geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings. Derivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied \\nto other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark to market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash \\ncollateral to cover exposures. Daily monitoring is undertaken by the Bank’s Treasury department, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers \\nfor escalation.\\n\\n136 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n24 Financial risk management continued\\nThe table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet, including derivatives.

Before 11 March 2018, the Group classified its financial assets as loans and receivables, FVPL or available-for-sale financial assets \\nin accordance with IAS 39.\\n\\nTo determine their classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be assessed \\nbased on a combination of the entity’s business model for managing the assets and the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics.\\n\\nIn order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely \\npayments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an \\ninstrument level.\\n\\nThe business model assessment reflects how the Group manages the risks relating to the underlying financial assets, including whether the Group’s principal \\nobjective is to collect the contractual cash flows arising from the instruments (amortised cost), to sell the financial instruments (FVPL) or a combination \\nthereof (FVOCI).\\n\\nFinancial instruments at amortised cost\\nFinancial assets that are principally held for the collection of contractual cash flows and which pass the SPPI test are classified as amortised cost. For the \\nGroup, these are financial assets that are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, \\nand where the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding. The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables and they include amounts due from Financial Services \\ncustomers and amounts due from other banks. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the Group \\ninitially measures these financial assets at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using \\nthe effective interest method. Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the income statement.\\n\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\nFinancial assets that are held for both the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and to sell are classified as FVOCI. Initial recognition is at fair value \\nplus transaction costs, with subsequent movements in fair value being recognised through OCI. Interest income measured using the effective interest rate \\nmethod and impairment gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.\\n\\nUpon initial recognition, the Group occasionally elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI when they meet \\nthe definition of Equity under IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-\\nby-instrument basis. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to the income statement. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as \\nother operating income when the right of the payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of the cost of \\nthe instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.\\n\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are \\nacquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective \\nhedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through \\nprofit or loss, irrespective of the business model.\\n\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised \\nin the income statement.\\n\\nb) Impairment of financial assets\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Group’s accounting for loan loss impairments by replacing IAS 39’s incurred loss approach with a \\n3 stage forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECL for all loans and other debt financial \\nassets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\\n\\nECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects \\nto receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral \\nheld or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\\n\\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Group establishes provisions against trade receivables to reflect the lifetime expected credit loss, consistent \\nwith the simplified approach under IFRS 9.\\n\\nc) Financial Services loans and advances including impairment\\nFor Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending, storecard lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups \\nof assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level. The allowance is calculated by reference to the estimated probability of default \\n(PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD).\\n— The probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting within 12 months from the balance sheet date or within the expected lifetime \\n\\nof the borrower.\\n— Exposure at default represents the expected amount due from the borrower at the point of default by reference to exposure at the balance sheet date \\n\\nadjusted for expected future changes including repayments and utilisation of undrawn facilities.\\n— Loss given default represents the expected percentage loss at the point of default relative to the EAD.\\n\\n 141Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n25 Financial instruments continued\\nECL 3 stage model\\n— Stage 1 – Impairment allowance on financial assets that have not significantly increased in credit risk since origination, nor are credit impaired, \\n\\nis calculated using the probability that a borrower will default within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Interest income is recognised on \\nthe gross carrying value of the financial asset.\\n\\n— Stage 2 – Where a financial asset exhibits a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) but is not yet considered to be credit impaired, the probability \\nof default considered in the impairment allowance is based upon the lifetime probability of the borrower defaulting. Interest income continues \\nto be recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset. \\n\\n— Stage 3 – Assets considered to be credit impaired resulting from one or more events have occurred that has resulted in a detrimental impact on the \\nestimated future cash flows of the asset. Stage 3 assets will continue to recognise lifetime expected impairment losses (with a 100% probability of \\ndefault) and interest income will be recognised on the net carrying amount (i.e. gross amount less impairment allowance).\\n\\nIn determining ECL allowances, expected future recoveries are discounted to the reporting date at the original effective interest rate of the relevant \\ninstrument.\\n\\nSignificant increases in credit risk\\nThe Group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk by reference to quantitative thresholds, qualitative indicators and has also \\nchosen to adopt the rebuttable backstop presumption that credit risk has significantly increased if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.\\n\\nDefinition of default\\nThe Group’s definition of default is used in determining those accounts classified as stage 3 (i.e. credit impaired). The Group has chosen not to rebut the \\nbackstop presumption prescribed by IFRS 9 that where an account is 90 days or more past its due date then default has occurred.\\n\\nWhere an account no longer meets any of the default criteria, such as by bringing payments back up to date, the Group will continue to consider the account \\nas being in default for a period of 24 months from the date when it last met the definition of default.\\n\\nExpected lifetime\\nFor the purposes of considering the lifetime probability of default, the expected lifetime of a financial asset is the contractual term where this is fixed within \\nthe contract, or in the case of revolving products such as credit cards a behavioural life is determined by reference to historic trends.\\n\\nd) Financial liabilities\\nThe classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 are largely unchanged with all of the Group’s financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost, \\nand derivative financial liabilities classified as FVPL.\\n\\nFinancial liabilities costs, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the \\nincome statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled \\nin the period in which they arise.\\n\\nThe fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond. \\nThis amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds \\nare allocated to the conversion option which is recognised in shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects and is not subsequently remeasured.\\n\\nIssue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts at the date of issue.\\n\\nInterest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts, other deposits and amounts due to Sainsbury’s Bank customers are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally \\nthe proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n\\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.\\n\\n142 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n25 Financial instruments continued\\nFinancial assets and liabilities by category\\nSet out below are the accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities as at 9 March 2019 and 10 March 2018.

As at 9 March 2019, the Group had \\n£1 million (2018: £2 million) under this facility. \\n\\ng) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\\nAccounting policies\\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks. All derivative financial \\ninstruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates. Where derivatives \\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in the income statement as finance \\nincome or costs as they arise.\\n\\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between \\nthe hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risks being hedged and an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging \\nrelationship to ensure it is highly effective on an ongoing basis.\\n\\nWhere a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in fair value are recognised depending on the nature of the hedge relationship and the \\nitem being hedged as follows:\\n\\nCash flow hedges\\nHedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows \\nresulting from a highly probable forecasted transaction. These include the exchange rate risk of inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency, as \\nwell as the commodity risk on purchases of power and fuel. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective \\nas hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the \\nincome statement.\\n\\nIf a cash flow hedge is hedging a firm commitment or forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time \\nthe asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are \\nincluded in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.\\n\\n146 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n25 Financial instruments continued\\nPortfolio hedges\\nSainsbury’s Bank uses portfolio fair value hedging as a risk management tool for hedging interest rate risk on the Personal Loans and Mortgage portfolios. \\nPortfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures. The hedged item can \\nbe designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity.\\n\\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. \\nAt that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in equity until the forecasted \\ntransaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income \\nis transferred to the income statement for the period.\\n\\nFair value hedges\\nHedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of a financial asset or \\nliability due to movements in interest rates. The changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement. The hedged item \\nis also adjusted for changes in fair value with the corresponding adjustment made in the income statement.\\n\\nThe effects of hedge accounting on the Group’s financial position and

This is \\nan inflation-linked amortising loan from Longstone Finance plc with an outstanding principal value of £687 million (2018: £712 million) at a fixed real rate of \\n2.36 per cent where principal and interest rate are uplifted annually by RPI subject to a cap at five per cent and a floor at nil per cent with a carrying amount \\nof £704 million (2018: £730 million) with a final repayment date of April 2031.\\n\\nThe Group has entered into inflation swaps to convert £540 million (2018: £590 million) of the £687 million (2018: £712 million) loan due 2031 from RPI linked \\ninterest to fixed rate interest for periods maturing April 2019 to April 2023. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges (note 24).\\n\\nThe principal activity of Longstone Finance plc is the issuing of commercial mortgage backed securities and applying the proceeds towards the secured loans \\ndue 2031 with the Group as summarised above. \\n\\nIntertrust Corporate Services Limited holds all the issued share capital of Longstone Finance Holdings Limited on trust for charitable purposes. Longstone \\nFinance Holdings Limited beneficially owns all the issued share capital of Longstone Finance plc. As the Group has no interest, power or bears any risk over \\nthese entities they are not included in the Group consolidation.\\n\\nb) Bank overdrafts\\nBank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above Bank of England base rate.\\n\\nc) Short-term borrowings\\nOn 22 June 2018 the Group extended its syndicated committed revolving credit facility by one year. The facility of £1.45 billion has four, five and six-year \\ntranches with a current final maturity for the longer dated tranche of April 2024. As at 9 March 2019, £35 million had been drawn (2018: £nil).  \\n\\nThe revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates and drawdowns bear interest at a margin above LIBOR. \\n\\nIn December 2018, a new £100 million uncommitted facility was agreed to provide an additional capacity to fund short term working capital requirements. \\nDrawdowns of this facility bear interest at a margin over LIBOR. The uncommitted facility was £100 million drawn down at 9 March 2019 (2018: £nil). \\n\\nd) Bank loans due 2019\\nOn 5 May 2015, the Group amended its £200 million unsecured bank loan due August 2019 into a secured corporate £200 million bank loan due August 2019 \\nat a floating rate of interest. £100 million of this has been swapped into a fixed rate liability. The £100 million portion of the loan and associated interest rate \\nswap has been designated as a cash flow hedge.\\n\\ne) Convertible bond due 2019\\nIn November 2014, the Group issued £450 million of unsecured convertible bonds due November 2019. The bonds pay a coupon of 1.25 per cent payable semi-\\nannually. Each bond is convertible into ordinary shares of J Sainsbury plc at any time up to 21 November 2019 at a conversion price of 302.31 pence. \\n\\nThe net proceeds of the convertible bond have been split as at 9 March 2019 into a liability component of £445 million and an equity component of £5 million. \\nThe equity component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company.\\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nLiability component brought forward 436 427\\nInterest expense 14 14\\nInterest paid (6) (6)\\nOther1 1 1\\nLiability component as at the end of the year 445 436 \\n\\n1 Other relates to fees.\\n\\nf) Sainsbury’s Bank Tier 2 Capital due 2027\\nThe Bank issued £175 million of fixed rate reset callable subordinated Tier 2 notes on 23 November 2017.

Financing was in the form of Term Loans amounting to £3.5 \\nbillion, split over two Facilities. In addition, an upsize of £550 million to Facility B of the existing Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) was arranged in order to provide \\nsufficient contingent funding to the Group.

The defined benefit obligation is actuarially calculated \\non an annual basis using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are recorded at fair value. \\n\\nActuarial gains and losses are reported in the statement of other comprehensive income as incurred, and comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial \\nassumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.\\n\\nThe income statement charge consists of a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and interest income on plan assets \\nand defined benefit pension scheme expenses.\\n\\nThe financing charge is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the pension scheme liabilities and plan \\nassets at the beginning of the financial year.\\n\\nThe Group contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred. Any contributions unpaid at the balance \\nsheet date are included as an accrual as at that date. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. \\n\\nBackground\\nAt 9 March 2019, all retirement benefit obligations related to the Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme plus two unfunded pension liabilities relating to former senior \\nemployees of Sainsbury’s and Home Retail Group. \\n\\nOn 20 March 2018, the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme was merged into the Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme. The Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme now has two \\nsections, the Sainsbury’s section which holds all the Scheme assets and liabilities prior to the merger, and the Argos section which holds all the assets and \\nliabilities transferred into the Scheme from the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme. There have been no changes to members’ benefits and each section’s \\nassets have been segregated by deed and ring fenced for the benefit of the members of each section. The Scheme has 11 Trustee Directors (including three \\nfrom the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme). No further liabilities or assets remained in the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme and it was subsequently \\nwound up on 31 August 2018.\\n\\nThe retirement benefit obligations at the year-end have been calculated by KPMG, the actuarial advisers to the Group, using the projected unit credit method \\nand based on adjusting the position at the date of the previous triennial valuations (see below) for known events and changes in market conditions as \\nallowed under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. Assets are valued at bid price and are held separately from the Group’s assets.\\n\\nSainsbury’s section\\nThe Sainsbury’s section of the Scheme has three different benefit categories: final salary, career average and cash balance. For final salary and career \\naverage members, benefits at retirement are determined by length of service and salary. For cash balance members, benefits are determined by the accrued \\nretirement account credits. \\n\\nThe section was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002 and closed to future accrual on 28 September 2013. The Scheme is also used to pay life \\nassurance benefits to current (including new) colleagues. \\n\\nThis section was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation, carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee, as at 14 March 2015 on the projected unit basis \\nand a recovery plan was agreed. On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit at 14 March 2015 was £740 million, an increase of £148 million \\nfrom the March 2012 deficit.\\n\\nThe section continues to receive annual coupons from the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership that was established in 2010 which are based on the \\naverage weighted discount rate used in the triennial valuation and so are effectively reset every three years. These coupons are £19 million a year. \\n\\nThe section has a well-defined investment strategy which has been agreed with the Company. This aims for it to be funded on a low risk basis by 2023 \\nreferencing investment returns by asset class and based on forward-looking assumptions.\\n\\nArgos section\\nThe section holds the assets and liabilities transferred from the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme, which was closed to new employees in 2009 and \\nto future accrual in January 2013. Pension benefits were based on service and final salary. \\n\\nThe Home Retail Group Pension Scheme was subject to a triennial valuation, carried out by Willis Towers Watson for the Trustee, as at 31 March 2015 on \\nthe projected unit basis and a recovery plan was agreed. On the basis of the assumptions agreed, the actuarial deficit as at 31 March 2015 was £315 million, \\nan increase of £157 million from the March 2012 deficit.\\n\\nFollowing merger the section has defined its investment strategy which has been agreed with the Company. This aims for it to be funded on a low risk basis \\nby 2025 referencing investment returns by asset class based on forward-looking assumptions. \\n\\n154 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n30 Retirement benefit obligations continued\\nContributions to Scheme\\nUnder the Recovery Plans agreed as part of the 2015 triennial valuation process the Group is contracted to make contributions totalling £124 million in 2019/20 \\nwhich includes the £19 million coupon from Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership. The 2018 triennial valuation is currently being agreed with the Trustee.\\n\\nUnfunded pension liabilities\\nThe unfunded pension liabilities are unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised \\nin the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.\\n\\nIFRIC 14\\nIFRIC 14 is the interpretation that details when a company can recognise any pension surplus that exists. Furthermore, if the company has a funding \\ncommitment in excess of the IAS 19 deficit, then IFRIC 14 requires recognition of this excess in those circumstances when the surplus that would result \\non fulfilling that commitment cannot be recognised. A surplus may be recognised either because of an unconditional right to a refund to the company, \\nor on grounds of a future contribution reduction where schemes are still open to future accrual.\\n\\nFor the Sainsbury’s section, management is of the view that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14. As such no adjustment \\nhas been made for potential additional liabilities.\\n\\nBased on the net deficit of the Argos section as at 9 March 2019 and the committed payments under the Schedule of Contributions signed on 2 September \\n2016, there is a notional surplus of £134 million. \\n\\nManagement is of the view that, based on the scheme rules, it does not have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14, and therefore an \\nadditional balance sheet liability in respect of a ‘minimum funding requirement’ of £134 million has been recognised.\\n\\na) Income statement\\nThe amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: \\n\\n2019 \\n£m \\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nExcluded from underlying profit before tax:   \\n Interest cost on pension liabilities1 (279) (289)\\n Interest income on plan assets 271 263\\nTotal included in finance costs (note 7) (8) (26)\\n  \\nDefined benefit pension scheme expenses (10) (10)\\nPast service (cost)/credit (98) 31\\nTotal excluded from underlying profit before tax (116) (5)\\n \\nTotal income statement expense (116) (5)\\n\\n1 Includes interest of £1 million for the unfunded pension scheme (2018: £1 million) and £2 million in relation to interest on the minimum funding requirement.\\n\\nPast service amounts\\nOn 26 October 2018, the High Court ruled in the landmark Lloyds Banking Group case on Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs). The judgment requires \\nequalisation between men and women for the effect of unequal GMPs. The Group has worked with the Trustee of the Scheme and independent actuaries and \\nestimated the cost of equalising benefits at £98 million for the Sainsbury’s section and £3 million for the Argos section. \\n\\nThis cost for the Sainsbury’s section has been recognised in the consolidated income statement as a non-underlying item for the 52 weeks ended 9 March \\n2019 (2018: £nil).

Both sections of the Scheme hold a \\nsignificant proportion of growth assets such as equities and \\nreal estate. Whilst growth assets are expected to outperform \\ncorporate bond yields over the long term this might not always \\noccur in the short term. \\n\\nAll equities are invested passively. The equity portfolio \\nincludes both emerging markets and smaller companies in \\norder to track global economic growth by replicating global \\nequity capitalisation. Asset volatility is therefore mitigated by \\ninvesting in as many companies as possible. All other assets \\nare invested actively and are widely diversified to reduce \\nreturns risk and enhance returns.\\n\\nCurrency The Scheme’s liabilities are sterling based whereas the majority \\nof assets are denominated in foreign currencies.\\n\\nCurrency hedging programmes help dampen returns \\nvolatility caused by the fluctuation of sterling against other \\nleading currencies.\\n\\nChanges in  \\nbond yields\\n\\nA decrease in bond yields, which in turn drive the discount rate, \\nwill increase the present value of the Scheme’s liabilities for \\naccounting purposes.\\n\\nA significant proportion of assets are held in corporate bonds \\nthat provide a hedge against falling bond yields. Furthermore \\nsignificant levels of interest rate hedging within the Scheme’s \\nliability hedging portfolios through interest rate derivatives \\nserve to protect against falling bond yields. Buy-in policies \\ntransfer a proportion of interest rate risk to an insurer.\\n\\nInflation The majority of the Scheme’s liabilities are linked to UK price \\ninflation indices (to a maximum of five per cent per year).\\n\\nLiability hedging portfolios hedge significant proportions \\nof inflation liabilities by holding index linked bonds and \\ninflation rate derivatives. The Scheme’s equity portfolio \\nprovides a natural hedge against inflation. Buy-in policies \\ntransfer a proportion of inflation risk to an insurer.\\n\\nLongevity Beneficiaries living longer than expected could increase the \\nScheme’s liabilities.\\n\\nBuy-in policies transfer some longevity risk to an insurer.\\n\\nOperational Poor administration of benefits may result in an increased \\ndefined benefit obligation in future years.\\n\\nThe Scheme’s benefits administrators have agreed service \\nlevel agreements and controls are carefully monitored.\\n\\n 157Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n30 Retirement benefit obligations continued\\nThe major categories of plan assets are as follows:\\n\\nQuoted \\n2019 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nUnquoted1\\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\nQuoted \\n2018 \\n\\n£m\\n\\nUnquoted1\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nEquity\\nPublic2 972 – 1,422 –\\nPrivate – 322 – 267\\n   \\nBonds3   \\nGovernment bonds 1,620 – 1,269 –\\nCorporate bonds 3,950 (51) 3,695 (35)\\nEmerging market bonds 462 (6) 444 –\\n     \\nDerivatives4 278 743 163 558\\n     \\nAlternatives     \\nReal estate 67 591 64 561\\nPrivate debt – 479 – 404\\nDiversified growth – – 188 –\\nInsurance policies5 – 306 – 334\\nCash and cash equivalents 252 (2) 558 (8)\\n\\n7,601 2,382 7,803 2,081\\n\\nNotes \\n1  Certain unquoted fixed interest securities, private equity and debt investments and property investments are stated at fair value.

All share options are valued using an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes or \\nMonte Carlo). This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme with a corresponding increase \\nin equity. \\n\\nFor cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge \\nrecognised through the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with a corresponding increase in accruals. \\n\\nThe value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, \\nwith the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.\\n\\nThe grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital \\ncontribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period \\nas an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity. \\n\\nThe Group recognised £39 million (2018: £33 million) of employee costs (note 29) related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year. \\nOf these, £1 million (2018: £nil) were cash-settled.\\n\\nThe Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below:\\n\\na) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave)\\nThe Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months’ continuous service. This is \\nan approved HMRC scheme and was established in 1980. Under Sharesave, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at the end of the three-year \\nor five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.

The core awards are calculated as a \\npercentage of the participants’ salaries and scaled according to grades. \\n\\nPerformance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required performance conditions have been met, the awards vest and \\n50 per cent of the award will be released. Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released one year after \\nthe vesting date. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire five years from the grant date. \\n\\nFor Executive Directors, awards will normally be subject to a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performing period. Options granted \\nto acquire the award of shares will expire six years from the date of grant. \\n\\nDividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.\\n\\nThe core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.

These are intended to reward the Directors in the Company, \\nincluding Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company. \\nAwards are structured as nil cost options. \\n\\nShare-based awards are made to participants subject to performance against a basket of measures. At least 50 per cent of the awards are based on the \\ndelivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders. The balance is based on measures which will assess the Company’s performance relative \\nto its competitors as well as key strategic goals.\\n\\nPerformance against the target is measured over one financial year. Any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that management’s \\ninterests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders.

In addition, an acquisition fair value gain of £4 million on the previously held equity interest in Insight 2 Communication LLP was recorded in other \\nincome (and excluded from underlying profit before tax). \\n\\n33 Operating lease commitments\\nAccounting policies\\nLeases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases \\nare classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.\\n\\na) Operating leases\\n Rental expenses for assets leased under operating leases are charged directly to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n\\nb) Sale and leaseback\\nA sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering into a lease with the \\nbuyer. \\n\\nFor sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating leasebacks, \\ngenerally the assets are sold at fair value, and the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the income statement.\\n\\nc) Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases\\nThe Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental increases. These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term \\nof the lease. Where future rental increases are non-predetermined, future increments are only included if they can be reliably estimated.\\n\\n164 Financial Statements\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements continued\\n\\nJ Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n33 Operating lease commitments continued\\nd) Operating lease income\\nOperating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n\\nThe Group leases various retail stores, offices, depots and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. The leases have varying terms, escalation \\nclauses and renewal rights.\\n\\nThe table below sets out the Group’s reasonably certain future lease payments:\\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nAggregate future minimum lease payments:   \\n Within one year 765 743\\n In the second to fifth years inclusive 2,559 2,565\\n After five years 6,774 6,711\\n 10,098 10,019\\n\\nFurther analysis of the Group’s future minimum lease payments after five years is as follows:\\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nAggregate future minimum lease payments:  \\n Greater than five years but less than ten years 2,082 2,073\\n Greater than ten years but less than 15 years 1,484 1,396\\n After 15 years 3,208 3,242\\n 6,774 6,711\\n\\nThe commercial terms of the Group’s operating leases vary, however they commonly include either a market rent review or an index linked rent review \\n(with a cap and collar). The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease. The Group has pre-emption rights over a minor number of properties, \\nwhich provides the Group with the right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event the landlord chooses to sell. The option price payable for the \\nasset in each instance is normally referenced to current market value prevailing at the point of pre-emption. \\n\\nThe Group sublets certain properties:\\n\\n2019 \\nLeased \\n\\nproperties\\n£m\\n\\n2019 \\nOwned \\n\\nproperties\\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\nLeased \\n\\nproperties\\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\nOwned \\n\\nproperties\\n£m\\n\\nAggregate future minimum lease receipts:   \\n Within one year 23 20 21 20\\n In the second to fifth years inclusive 61 54 56 57\\n After five years 58 49 62 57\\n 142 123 139 134\\n\\n34 Capital commitments \\nAt 9 March 2019, capital commitments contracted, but not provided for by the Group, amounted to £90 million (10 March 2018: £103 million) and £7 million for \\nthe property joint ventures (10 March 2018: £55 million).\\n\\n35 Financial commitments \\nSainsbury’s Bank has off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit to customers of £323 million (2018: £267 million).\\n\\nAt the year-end, £18 million of expected credit loss provisions are recognised in respect of off-balance sheet loan commitments in line with IFRS 9.\\n\\n36 Contingent liabilities\\nThe Group has a number of contingent liabilities in respect of historic lease guarantees, particularly in relation to the disposal of assets, which if the current \\ntenant and their ultimate parents become insolvent, may expose the Group to a material liability. This is not expected to materialise. In addition, the Group \\nhas a guarantee in relation to its beneficial interest in the property investment pool. The likelihood of a material claim against this guarantee is considered to \\nbe remote.\\n\\nAlong with other retailers, the Group is currently subject to approximately 2,000 claims brought by current and ex-employees in the Employment Tribunal \\nfor equal pay under the Equality Act 2010 and/or the Equal Pay Act 1970. Typically, claims of this nature can take many years to be determined. Given that the \\nclaims against the Group are still at a relatively early stage and the outcome of such claims is highly uncertain at this stage, the Group considers the likelihood \\nof a material payout to be remote. \\n\\n 165Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n37 Related party transactions \\na) Key management personnel\\nThe key management personnel of the Group comprise members of the J Sainsbury plc Board of Directors and the Operating Board.

accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, in particular Financial Reporting \\nStandard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006. FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a ‘qualifying \\nentity’ as defined in the Standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements \\nof qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) \\nas adopted by the European Union. \\n\\nThe Company’s transition date to FRS 101 was 13 March 2016. FRS 101 sets out amendments to IFRS as adopted by the European Union that are necessary \\nto achieve compliance with the Companies Act and related regulations. \\n\\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks to 9 March 2019 (prior financial year 52 weeks to 10 March 2018). \\n\\nThe disclosure exemptions adopted by the Company in accordance with FRS 101 are as follows:\\n— The requirements of IAS 7 to present a cash flow statement.\\n— The requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Transactions’, to disclose information related to key management personnel, and the \\n\\nrequirements of IAS 24 to disclose related party transactions between two or more members of a group for wholly owned subsidiaries.\\n— The requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 to disclose information assessing the possible impact of new standards issued but which are not \\n\\nyet effective.\\n— The requirements of IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 for disclosure of financial instruments and fair values. \\n\\nThe financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest £million unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared on the going concern \\nbasis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \\nthat have been measured at fair value.\\n\\nAmendments to published standards \\nEffective for the Group and Company in these financial statements:\\nThe Company considered the following amendments to published standards that are effective for the Company for the financial year beginning \\n11 March 2018 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Company or they do not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial \\nstatements. These standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the European Union.\\n— Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ on the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions\\n— Amendments to IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ on the transfers of investment property\\n— IFRIC Interpretation 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’\\n— Annual Improvements Cycle 2014-2016 (issued in December 2016)\\n— IFRS 4 ‘Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts’\\n— IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’\\n— IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’\\n\\nStandards and revisions effective for future periods:\\nThe following standards and revisions will be effective for future periods:\\n— IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ \\n— IFRIC Interpretation 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’\\n— Amendments to IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ on prepayment features with negative compensation\\n— Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ on the definition \\n\\nof material\\n— Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ on plan amendments, curtailments or settlements \\n— Amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ on long-term interests in associates and joint ventures\\n— Annual Improvements Cycle 2015-2017 (issued in December 2017)\\n\\nThe Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an income statement \\nnor a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone. \\n\\nThe loss after tax for the Company for the year was £36 million (2018: profit of £683 million). \\n\\nNotes to the Company financial statements\\n\\n 175Financial Statements J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019\\n\\nG\\novernance Report\\n\\nStrategic Report\\nFinancial Statem\\n\\nents\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Property, plant and equipment\\nAccounting policies\\na) Land and buildings\\nLand and buildings are held at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Capital work in progress is held \\nat cost less any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs to bringing the asset to its working \\ncondition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.\\n\\nb) Fixtures and equipment\\nFixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original \\npurchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use. \\n\\nc) Depreciation\\nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line basis, using the following rates:\\n— Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease term if shorter\\n— Fixtures, equipment and vehicles – three to 15 years \\n— Freehold land is not depreciated\\n\\nCapital work in progress is not depreciated.\\n\\nGains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds less any associated costs of disposal with the asset’s carrying amount and are \\nrecognised within operating profit. \\n\\nThe assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. \\n\\nImpairment of non-financial assets \\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that \\nthose assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs \\nto dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. \\n\\nWhere the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-\\ngenerating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. For Retail property, plant and equipment, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store or store pipeline \\ndevelopment site. Non-store assets, including depots and IT assets, are reviewed separately.\\n\\nAny impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses due to a change \\nin the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying value less \\nnotional accumulated depreciation if lower. \\n\\nLand and \\nbuildings\\n\\n£m\\n\\nFixtures and \\nequipment\\n\\n£m\\nTotal\\n\\n£m\\n\\nCost\\nAt 11 March 2018 – – –\\nAdditions 213 7 220\\n\\nAt 9 March 2019 213 7 220\\n\\nNo depreciation was charged during the year due to additions taking place at the end of the financial year.\\n\\n176 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2019Financial Statements\\nNotes to the Company financial statements continued\\n\\n\\n\\n3 Investments in subsidiaries\\nAccounting policies\\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the financial statements of the Company. \\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nShares in subsidiaries   \\nAt the beginning of the year 6,013 5,757\\nAdditions 148 256\\nAt the end of the year 6,161 6,013\\n\\nAdditions in the current year predominantly relate to capital injections into Sainsbury’s Bank of £110 million.

They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet \\ndate. Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired. On derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income reserves is recognised in the income statement for debt instruments. Gains and losses on equity instruments are never recycled \\nto the income statement. Dividends on FVOCI equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the entity’s right to receive payment is \\nestablished.

It is determined using tax \\nrates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax \\nasset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\\n\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can \\nbe utilised.\\n\\nDeferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Company is \\nable to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nCapital \\nlosses \\n\\n£m\\n\\nRolled over \\ncapital gains \\n\\n£m\\nTotal \\n\\n£m\\n\\nAt 10 March 2018 and 9 March 2019 21 (21) –\\n\\n2019 \\n£m\\n\\n2018 \\n£m\\n\\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities (21) (21)\\nTotal deferred income tax assets 21 21\\nNet deferred income tax liability recognised in non-current liabilities – –\\n\\n11 Share capital and reserves\\nAccounting policies\\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.
